I've started to write technical papers using latex in vscode but after a long time, I've started a journey into the terminal software, stuff like nnn, and went into neovim as a complete substitution for vscode, started with coc and few plugins like nerdtree. But I've faced the first issue... how to exit, move, etc xD, after all of that, cannot escape from the vim keybinds and also I've made the question: What makes the difference between neovim and vim? Started to use vim with a minimal vimrc.

&amp;#x200B;

I've started the vanilla vim usage as my main text editor in 2022, started to migrate from ycm to mucomplete, jedi and airline, discovering ale and the lsp support in this side of the river and trying options to optimize speed, discovering after a long time stuff like sessions, marks, macros and simply amazes me what vanilla vim can do, it is not a rant to other editors, is my experience and the travel to discover the full power of a software like this, in this year I've started to try to add more addons to vim-orgmode, writing a nerdfont glyph picker using fzf and still playing with the completion, thanks to Bram and all the people who still works in the most powerful editor in the market without all the fancy stuff, just the things that you need to make you work or have fun with, happy vimming to all, and happy holidays to everyone! 

PS: Remember, if the things you have doesn't interfere with performance or if that makes a slowdown but you are okay, it's correct to have it, a vimrc is a very personal setting.

18fj8zy,39,0.99,16,39,1971,320,2023-12-11T01:45:45Z,"Recently, I have found myself looking through the helpdocs a lot more for some more ""obscure""/random tidbits, along with finding some useful stuff which I don't currently utilize.  As such, I thought that it might be helpful to share some of the things I find every week!  Feel free to also share some of your own knowledge in the comments.

---

# Tidbit #1

### To kick this first one off, I will give a bit of a weirder/potentially surprising tidbit:

Commands which involve a pattern and are typically surrounded by slashes can instead be surrounded by any character (other than numbers, letters, \\, "", and |).  This allows you to use `/` within your patterns without escaping, etc.

For example, these are all equivalent:

`:%s/a/b`

`:%s=a=b`

`:%s+a+b`

(likewise with `:g` or `:v`)

For more information, look into `:h pattern-delimiter`.

---

# Tidbit #2

### Since the one above might be less useful, I thought that I would include some somewhat useful mappings vim has related to spellchecking:

- `zg` marks the word under the cursor as a valid word globally (uses spellfile; persists).
- `zw` marks the word under the cursor as an invalid word globally (uses spellfile; persists).
- `zG` and `zW` are the same as their counterparts, except it is local/internal (uses internal wordlist; it stays around for all open buffers until exiting vim).

For more information, look into `:h zg, zw, zG, zW, 'spellfile', internal-wordlist`.

By default, the global ones seem to store into `~/vimfiles/spell/en.utf-8.add`, though this might vary for you; when adding a good/bad word globally, it will tell you the path of this file at the bottom by where you enter commands.

---

*I have quite the collection of other more useful stuff, but it is currently scattered about in my notes, so I aim to consolidate all my notes into one spot for a, hopefully, ""more useful"" week 2.*

18fhswj,15,0.94,13,15,1689,295,2023-12-11T00:31:04Z,"For a long time I've assumed there is a fairly simple trick using substitute to cut linebreaks, and hence join lines. In particular I've always wanted to be able to quickly delete blank lines, in various situations. Turns out, it can't be done, at least as far as I know. Given that vim's subsitute (and GNU sed, and relevant stream editors) operate in a linewise fashion, there is *in principle* no way to substiute line breaks.

So, what's a monkey to do?

Well, in the vim user manual, `:help 25.4` there's a really handy command which explains how to truncate the text in your file onto a single line, for exporting to Word, or some other word processor.

`:g/./,/^$/join` - searches the file globally for any *non-blank* line, and then joins them together, except for when there's a blank line (which now that I think about it is actually the opposite of what I was looking for, anyway).

So, with a bit of playing around I figured out that I could do this:

`{range},g/^$/,/^/join`

What this does is from line `{range}`, to the cursor position, search 'globally' for all instances between a *blank* line, until the next start of line character, and join those together. So this:

line

line

line

Becomes this:

line  
line  
line  

Pretty cool I thought...

So then, I want to make it quick. You can't really make it a mapping, because you want to be able to enter the range value at the start.

So I put this in my vimrc:

`cabbrev linedel g/^$/,/^/join`

Now from the command line I can type in something like:

`:3,linedel`, then hit spacebar and enter, to 'delete' all blank lines from line 3, to the cursor position.

Hope other find this helpful.

Merry Christmas everyone.",t3
18fchvy,5,0.73,17,5,5424,632,2023-12-10T20:25:53Z,"Hi there,

I have been using Vi motions for Pycharm for a few months, and overall I am liking it. I am in most cases almost as fast as I used to be with my mouse, in some cases a little faster, and overall I have found myself to start liking it more and more, however there is one particular instance where I just don't know how to make something efficient.

Imagine I have a function consisting of 3 (or more) blocks of code, and I want to use a very similiar structure to create another function, with the only real difference being the variable names. Now let's say that in this case it isn't easily done to create some generic funnction that can take in the variable names, and thereby create distinct sets of code.

Without using Vi motions, I would normally do the following:
Copy paste my function and all the code in it, change the first block with the variable names manually (I have to type them out at least ones anyway), then I would in split view just double click one variable and ctrl+c, click the place where the old variable name was used in the function, ctrl+v, and do this for all 10 or so variables in under 30 seconds.

With Vi motions, I need to (and I hope I can get some help with what to do exactly): jump to the variable, ciw each variable, then jump to the virst variable again, select the beginning, yank it, go to the line where the old variable appeared, viwp. 
Now imagine I have to do it again, for another part where the old variable appeared, I then need to gv + y, move to the next variable  viw p. 

Another thing would be to visually select the part where the 3 variables and use a substitution, however that requires me to type out the substitution/variable name, apply it. gv to reselect the area, click ""up"" to get the previous substituion command, change the variable names, and reapply. This too seems less fast than what I can do with a mouse. 

How could I do this in a better way:

some random code that feels applicable (please note for those that use Dash, i am aware that call backs are also a decorator): 
I would want to change these variables and then change the rest of the function appropiately:
 
    hidden_gas_output = html.Div(style = {'display': 'none'})
    gas_usage = dbc.Input(value=input_data.C45)
    gas_price = dbc.Input(value=input_data.C46)
    EB_and_ODE_gas = dbc.Input(value=input_data.C48)
    contract_fee_gas = dbc.Input(value=input_data.C49)
    number_of_connections_gas = dbc.Input(value=input_data.C51)
    percentage_used_for_heating_gas = dbc.Input(value=input_data.C52)
    gas_price_total_per_m3 = dbc.Input(value=input_data.C53)
    gasprice_scenario = dcc.Dropdown([""dynamic"", ""static""], ""dynamic"")
    yearly_gas_price_increase = dbc.Input(value=input_data.C55)

    app.callback(
        ddep.Output(hidden_gas_output, 'children'),
        [
            ddep.Input(gas_usage, 'value'),
            ddep.Input(gas_price, 'value'),
            ddep.Input(contract_fee_gas, 'value'),
            ddep.Input(EB_and_ODE_gas, 'value'),
            ddep.Input(number_of_connections_gas, 'value'),
            ddep.Input(percentage_used_for_heating_gas, 'value'),
            ddep.Input(gas_price_total_per_m3, 'value'),
            ddep.Input(gasprice_scenario, 'value'),
            ddep.Input(yearly_gas_price_increase, 'value')
        ],
        prevent_initial_call=True)(update_output)

Let's say that I change above functions to be about electricity and grab their inputs from a different place, I want to keep the names resembling what they are actually doing, and maybe I want to deal with electricity slightly differently than i want to deal with gas inputs, therefore I cannot create a generic function, how can I efficiently go about what I could do with mouse in a very short time?

    def update_border_when_input_incorrect(gas_usage, gas_price, eb_and_ode, contract_fee, number_of_connections, percentage_used_for_heating,
                      gas_price_total_per_m3,  yearly_gas_price_increase):
        styles = [{}] * 8  # Initialize styles for three inputs
        for i, value in enumerate([gas_usage, gas_price, eb_and_ode, contract_fee, number_of_connections, percentage_used_for_heating,
                      gas_price_total_per_m3,  yearly_gas_price_increase]):
            value = str(value)
            if value is not None and not value.replace('.', '', 1).isdigit():
                styles[i] = {'border': '2px solid red'}  # Apply red border if value is not numeric
        return tuple(styles)

I am quite new to vim. I want to enable the python3 runtime in it.

I ran the `:version` command in vim and found out that `python` and `pyhton3` were not supported since they had a (-)sign in front of them. 

I did some googling landed on these:

[Link1](https://richrose.dev/posts/linux/vim/vim-compile/) : This guides me to re-install and compile the vim with new configurations.

Then I went to [official vim](https://github.com/vim/vim) GitHub and looked around and it also had only instruction for installing vim  from scratch.

What I want is to be able to enable the python3 runtime support without re-installing the whole thing.

Is it possible?

The thing is I have trouble customized the color scheme. I dislike any of the mod scheme i found online. So i tried to change vim python in .vimrc file. It's not working at all. I put something like this

`syntax on`

`hi pythonComment ctermfg=2 gui=italic guifg=#408010`

in .rc nothing happened. I tried to look up but found no good documentation for this. VIM has it's documentation but seems not for each individual language. I also want to customize C++ and other languages in the future. Should i do these individually? I'm fine with it but I can't find anything helpful online.

That's the thing about IDEs like PyCharm. It's good a lot of times because there are an army of devs maintain and making it accessible to newbies. Colorscheme in pycharm is pretty, and easily adjustable. But Vim seems no docs for most customization. It's just vim lovers make their own thing and put in online, very scattered.

Also anyone think YouCompleteMe is trash? I rarely use this word but I have to now. Cause it's nowhere near the power of IDE autocomplete. Laggy, or simply not showing. Could you recommend some mod for me in python and C++?

I wrote these mappings a while ago and have found them quite useful.

Effectively, these mappings:

* grep through all open files for either the last pattern you searched with or your visual selection
* populates these results into the error list
* shows the error list, which lists all matching lines in all open files which match the pattern/selection (including file name, line numbers, and column numbers)
* allows you to jump directly between these matches (across files) with `&lt;up&gt;` and `&lt;down&gt;`

I was looking at the answers for [this question on StackExchange](https://vi.stackexchange.com/q/3093/37532) and started modifying one the answers for Linux to make it work better and work with Windows. It was a lot more difficult than I was expecting, so I thought I might as well make it a plugin when I finally got it working well.

It changes the font size (and therefore window size too) in gvim, using Ctrl+/- or mousewheel.

Works on Linux and Windows.

I made these mappings mode-specific by putting them inside the MyDiff() function in \_vimrc, as this function gets called when entering ""diff mode"".

      syntax match TOTAL ""^Summary.*""
      syntax match MARK ""^&gt;.*""

The problem is that the `MARK` group does not work (see attached image). Even more strange is that if I manually type `:syntax match MARK ""^&gt;.*` then it does work, and the output of `syntax` is now (note the doubled and redundant match):

    MARK           xxx match /^&gt;.*/

Why it does not work in first instance? Why does it need to have match doubled for it to work?

17zzcgc,7,0.82,15,7,3014,525,2023-11-20T21:21:00Z,"Hi,

First of all, apologize for my grammatical errors and for the long paragraph.I think I need tips AND/OR motivation to keep using Vim because I feel that I'm almost to the point where everything feels so cool.

**Some context about me**

I work as a web developer, I'm 31yo, I live in France (yep, my keyboard is azerty). I work as web developer for more than 10 years now, and I really love my job and do my best to improve myself, knowing that I lack some algorithms knowledge.

About my editor experiences, I started with Sublime Text at the time it was used almost everywhere for software development, and then I switched to Intellij, and I felt in love with it.

I started using Vim only 1 week ago, exactly it was on November 11th during the evening, I remember it well because I discovered ThePrimeagen channel and wanted to give a try to Vim.

My config is really cool to me, I made it ""by myself"", meaning that I took my time and did not used any pre-configured distro, but just created my lua files 1 by 1. I have everything working perfectly on my repositories: LSP, a nice colorscheme, and some cool plugins (telescope, harpoon, vim-surround, and bunch of other utilities)

I'm also getting used to Vim motions and basic vim mappings, I think I have some of the basics:

\- Jump vertically with `(number)j/k`

\- Move horizontally with `w`, `b`, `F`, `f`, `T`, `t`

\- Quickly edit with c(i-a)(w or anyting), di(w-...)

\- Search with / or vim-flash

To be clear, I'm really not saying that I know most of the commands, but it seems to me as a good starting point.

&amp;#x200B;

**Friction point**

Here is where I struggle the most: when I need to combine jumps and horizontal movements to edit some code that I visually see on my screen. Here is an example:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ria9u7xnkk1c1.png?width=1794&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25a8e30ac002cb1fd01c71e866796eedb53a7619

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, my cursor is on the `y` of the first line, and, let's say that for some reason I need to edit the `HapoonNavNext()` because I misspelled it and want to instead write `HarpoonNavFinal()`. Here are the 2 combinations I see and usually use:

\- Jump down 2 lines with `2j`, then either move with `w`, or `fH`, and then `ciw`. Also, the simple fact of thinking of the fastest keystroke when using `f` or `t` makes me feel like I lose time.

\- Search for my word: `/HarpoonNavNext` and perform replacement

This is really my biggest friction point, the thing is that I can't stop thinking that it would be so much faster with the mouse, but every time I'm tempted to use it I feel like I'm cheating.

Do you have some tips to ease this process of combining vertical and horizontal movements almost at the same time ? What's for you the most efficient way to perform this ? I am not necessarily in need of a magical command that I don't know, I just don't know what's the more efficient, so I can get used to a good practice to get faster.

I came up with a working solution which looks ugly to my non-coder eyes. Still, I'm proud of myself though, I'm just a writer who loves writing in Vim, after all.

We yank the leftmost character to register b, yank the next character to register a, merge the two registers into register c in reverse order (a + b), delete the two characters to the black hole register, and paste from c.

Any thoughts on how to make this look prettier?

    "" swap two characters via registers merge
    command! -bar SwapCharsYank execute 'normal ""byll""ayl'
    command! -bar SwapCharsMerge execute 'let @c = @a . @b'
    command! SwapCharsReplace execute 'normal vh""_d""cPh'
    command! SwapChars execute 'SwapCharsYank|SwapCharsMerge|SwapCharsReplace'

EDIT: I just discovered I can use uppercase versions of registers to append text, I mean I stupidly thought this would append things linewise only.

So this  simply becomes:

    command! SwapChars execute 'normal! ""aylh""Aylvl""_d""aP'

Now onto the next callenge: making it repeatable...

`helloWorld` \- `hello-world` \- `HELLO_WORLD` \- `Hello world` \- ...

(name ""chase"" is for ""***ch***ange c***ase***"")

Originally it was forked from 'vim-case-change', but has been completely rewritten.

Why  made another plugin for this?  
The main purpose is to see a popup list of words and see how many times should change caseAnother is to have customizable list of variants, and make it work differently with single letter, word or complete sentence (or someComplexNameOfVariable).

How does it work?  
First, place cursor at &lt;cword&gt; (or visual select) and press `~` one or several times.  
Plugin will **recognize** current word's case and **change** word, showing upcoming variants.  
Also it will **highlight** changes.  
Undo should work as it was single action

Plugin is written in vim9script.

17ytm04,110,0.98,11,110,3366,587,2023-11-19T09:40:42Z,"Hello Everyone! w0rp here. I thought I'd ask on Reddit if there's anyone out there would like to help maintain [ALE](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale). It would be nice to have another willing volunteer who is up for providing relevant feedback on PRs, answering common questions, merging good PRs, and managing GitHub issues. I'll mention to anyone interested that I have a general policy of never closing issues, no matter how old, unless they are actually either solved or invalid. I bear no compulsions to ensure an that a number of issues, which is arbitrary, remains low. I have a relatively simple vetting process, which mostly just requires building trust over time.

I'd like to add a little more context about [Dense Analysis](https://denseanalysis.org/) in the form of a bit of history. Originally I created ALE in a week or two, just in time for the release of Vim 8.0, knowing it wouldn't be too difficult to make an async Syntastic with the newly available APIs. Years later I realised in order to manage issues properly I'd need a GitHub organisation, which anyone can create easily on GitHub. Last year, 2022, I thought it would be a good idea to turn that org, Dense Analysis, into an actual charity and move the 2-clause BSD copyright to that charity instead of my online moniker. That charity is now a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, which I'm going to leverage to build a lot of interesting stuff in future.

Dense Analysis now has GitHub, Jira, Google Workspace, Windows licences, a Slack, Notion, a Discord, probably just a couple of LastPass licences soon, and probably other great stuff I'm forgetting about, most of which are provided to us for free. Theres $0 of revenue at the moment, but I'm aiming to open a corporate bank account in the name of the nonprofit, and by the Conflict of Interest policy and standard US laws, I will be barred from using that money for anything but the nonprofit's purposes. I've gone out of my way to set it up that way. This is all to say: I'll open up GitHub Sponsors, Patreon, PayPal, etc. in the coming months, and I and others can donate money to the charity. I intend on spending the money on various expenses including building bare-metal network infrastructure for running FOSS LLM tools. (like GPT) I've personally invested at least $1,500 myself already. I'll repeat that I don't need any further income than what my day job provides.

I'll be spending a lot of time building up the corporate structure for the charity and working on AI projects, when I'm not working on my somewhat demanding day job, or the roughly two bands I'm recording music for and performing in. (Which is fun!) I don't have a whole lot of time for merging ALE code and so on, but I will be working on it until I'm physically unable. I did a massive push a couple of months ago or so all at once to make a large series of improvements. I hope to do a lot more over the Christmas period, including supporting more of the `nvim-lspconfig` supported tools, and for Neovim integrating more closely with Neovim standard APIs now, while still supporting Vim 8+. (I will at some point in future require a newer Vim 8.x version.)

I'll forever be grateful to the probably hundreds of people across the world who have contributed to ALE. It's not my plugin, _it's everyone's plugin_. I hope it remains to be useful for many years to come.",t3

As of right now, I see that one of the reasons that you would use vim is  speed and accessibility to common movements that your cursor do around the code that you are editing, AKA Vim motions.

So one of the benchmarks that I was thinking of is assuming that a key press takes x seconds, and that is linear accross the number of keys that I press, how much keystrokes takes me to do X task using hotkeys on an editor like VSCode vs Vim. 

And I do not see myself slow or using the mouse to often whenever I'm in any other development IDE, since I'm always into looking how can I maximize this task and do not use inconsistence mouse movements.

And usually people that use Vim compared to a guy that does not know any hotkeys on their IDE, uses the scrollbar on the right side to get down the page, does not know cmd + p, clicks all the time he needs to jump between files and the terminal and the file tree, he will obviusly be MUCH slower overall. 

Again, for me the selling point of having vim goes beyond your editor, and knowing more your OS more intricately, and it's tools. That alone it's a great learning experience and well worth for you to customize things the way that you want. 

Hey you might have 9 fingers in your hand so you need your own remaps of hotkeys because the left shift it's to hard to reach, or anything related to that, that's power. 

But that benchmark of keypresses to action it's not compeling enought at this moment that I'm going though my learning proccess. (That I did solelly on my head, and estimations are rought enought so I can favor to NOT learn any new hotkeys, being lazy at the end of the day, but with a fair point) 

The sweet spot for me would be a conjuncting of Vim motions and my current setup. 

I do prefer the search functionality inside vim, but going forward or backwards between words using f F t T looks so unnecessary, instead a cmd or \^ + right, left arrow should do the trick. It's not like it would matter to end up exactly on a character that I need to ( at least I do not see it that way), because if my screen is where I want to, clicking right there seems the same amount of time, as of pressing 3 keys to get to my word.

1.) I kind of hate having the man page render in full screen window.
2.) I have no interest in viewing a page concerning some shell utility with the same name.

**Solution:** 

1.) Set the `$COLUMNS` variable before the man command.
2.) I specified the ordering I wanted the man pages to appear in.

    setlocal keywordprg=COLUMNS=135\ man\ -s\ 3,2,7,5,1

17s9x0b,0,0.45,4,0,2630,384,2023-11-10T18:06:58Z,"The Vim plugin **[Hjklmode](https://github.com/jamescherti/vim-hjklmode)** can be used to:
- **Learn HJKL navigation:** Hjklmode forces you to learn HJKL navigation as it disables certain keys that require moving the hand away from the Touch Typing position, which can disrupt typing flow. These keys include: Backspace, Arrows, Insert, Delete, Home, End, Page Up and Page Down.
- **Add HJKL navigation to other modes than Normal Mode:** Hjklmode adds the key mappings \&lt;Alt&gt;+hjkl to Insert Mode, Command Mode, and Terminal Mode.

Vim‚Äôs popularity is largely due to its ability to increase productivity through efficient navigation and editing techniques. One such technique is HJKL navigation, which allows using the H, J, K, and L keys to move the cursor left, down, up, and right. This method of navigation may seem strange at first, but it is actually a very efficient way to navigate through text and can greatly increase productivity when using Vim.

## Installation

Here is how to install Hjklmode using Vim's built-in package manager (Vim 8 and above):

```shell
mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/vim-plugins/start
cd ~/.vim/pack/vim-plugins/start
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/jamescherti/vim-hjklmode
vim -u NONE -c ""helptags vim-hjklmode/doc"" -c q
```

You can also install this Vim plugin with any third-party plugin manager such as Pathogen or Vundle.

## How to enable Hjklmode manually?
Run the following Vim command within Vim:
```viml
:HjklmodeEnable
```

## How to enable Hjklmode by default?

Add the following to `~/.vimrc`:
```viml
"" Disable the menu bar because it may prevent you from using the Alt key
set guioptions-=m

"" Enable Hjklmode by default
let g:hjklmode_enabled = 1

"" It is recommended to not disable the Escape key.
"" Disabling the Escape can cause issues with macros.
let g:hjklmode_disable_escape = 0
```

## How can I move the cursor, press Escape or Backspace when Hjklmode is enabled?
```
| Key mapping  | Equivalent to
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------
| Ctrl-[       | Escape (American English keyboard)
| Ctrl-C       | Similar to Escape (check *:help i_CTRL-C*)
| Ctrl-h       | Backspace
| Ctrl-j       | Enter
| Ctrl-m       | Enter
| Ctrl-i       | Tab
| Ctrl-f       | Page down
| Ctrl-b       | Page up
| h            | Left
| j            | Down
| k            | Up
| l            | Right

Since i still use lowercase letters for my regular binds after leader activation. I knew i couldn't just map the leader key to the single quote. Instead, i just decided to bruteforce it by using these types of mappings instead:

    keymap.set(""n"", ""&lt;leader&gt;A"", ""'A"", optsTable({ desc = ""Mark A"" }))
    keymap.set(""n"", ""&lt;leader&gt;B"", ""'B"", optsTable({ desc = ""Mark B"" }))
    keymap.set(""n"", ""&lt;leader&gt;C"", ""'C"", optsTable({ desc = ""Mark C"" }))
    keymap.set(""n"", ""&lt;leader&gt;D"", ""'D"", optsTable({ desc = ""Mark D"" }))
    keymap.set(""n"", ""&lt;leader&gt;E"", ""'E"", optsTable({ desc = ""Mark E"" }))

I don't think it's the most efficient way but i was impatient and it also allowed me to use the = expressions in my substitute command which i personally enjoy. Do tell me if there was a better way.  


So back to the \\= expression evaluator:

Initially i started by pasting this 26 times from lines(48 .. 73):

    keymap.set(""n"", ""&lt;leader&gt;A"", ""'A"", optsTable({ desc = ""Mark A"" }))

  
And then i ran this substitute command:

    :48,73s/A/\=nr2char(char2nr(""A"") + line('.') - 48)/g

  
Just Perfect. And to explain the expression:  


    char2nr(""A"")

Converts the character 'A' to its numeric representation.  


    line('.') - 48

Gets the current line number and subtracts 48 to adjust for the corresponding letter code.  


    nr2char(...)

Converts the result back to a character.  


And the global flag replaces at each instance. so Simple yet so Perfect.",t3
17qsc5s,12,0.83,4,12,8743,1367,2023-11-08T18:40:00Z,"I posted this to the Neovim sub, but I thought people might be interested here too. The only difference is going to be the mapping syntax appropriate for your .vimrc instead of a lua file.

I know it's not what most people would consider a Vim Clutch, but foot pedals are a silly addition to software centered around keyboard motions. But reading about Vim Clutches got me thinking about better ways to enter and exit modes. So here's what I did. Because simply remapping Caps to Esc is way less complicated, and therefore, way less good.

# What this Config does

## Key Mapping Info

* I used CapsLock for this because it's one of my least used keys, and the most annoying if accidentally pressed.
* I remapped to F9, an unused key in Vim/Nvim that doesn't seem to be used in most other web browsers or other applications I use. Although you should be able to use just about any other unused key. Unfortunately, it seems that Vim/Nvim doesn't like to map to any of the F13-F24 keys which would be handy.
* I used 'a' to enter Insert mode over 'i' for a few reasons, toggling back and forth doesn't make the cursor move backward, doing a quick toggle to paste puts the cursor after the content you pasted instead of behind the last character, and I find myself trying to hjkl or $ quickly to the end of a line more frequently than to the beginning.
* I use Esc to enter normal mode, and exit Visual and Command modes. It seems to work well.
* CapsLock is re-mapped to RAlt+CapsLock because I almost never use RAlt, and it still seemed convenient and appropriate.
* I configured this on Arch, Kmonad is cross-platform though.\
* Why not use QMK? Tbh I haven't played around much with QMK beyond mapping a few shortcuts to the Fn key on my desktop keyboard through VIA. I'm not sure if it is as powerful with controlling tap-and-hold features, or in general. But more importantly, this allows me to use basically the same config for my laptop, which doesn't have QMK.

## Insert Mode

* Tapping enters Normal mode
* Holding enters Normal mode and returns to Insert mode on release. You can enter any normal mode commands you would like.

## Normal Mode

* Tapping enters Insert mode
* Holding enters Insert mode and then returns to Normal mode on release

## Visual Mode

* If entered from Insert mode tapping returns to Insert mode, holding returns to Insert mode on press and Normal mode on release
* If entered from Normal mode tapping returns to Normal, holding returns to Normal mode on press and Insert mode on release

## Command Mode

* Tapping enters Normal mode
* Holding enters Normal mode on press and Insert mode on release

# Installation

There's a bunch of info on installing and configuring Kmonad. And I'm not one to write something that's already been written, so here's some links I found helpful:

* [Kmonad Github page](https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad) including install and config info
* [A tutorial from the Emacs sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/oyzfz9/kmonad_and_the_power_of_infinite_leader_keys/) with some nicely distilled info pulled from the Kmonad docs and more. Pay attention to the part at the beginning about configuring groups and udev rules.
* [A really good starter tutorial on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dhj1eauljwU) from Gavin Freeborn. I really appreciate him doing this. There's not a ton of tutorial info for Kmonad, and this got me going and interested much quicker than just digging through the docs off the bat.

# My Config

## Kmonad

This is my .kbd config. Some quick and dirty notes are that syntax is Lisp-like, a ;; is a line comment (a single ; is interpreted as the ; key) and #/ and |# start and end block comments. You basically want to lay your config out as visually representing your keyboard. I'm not actually clear on whether the exact layout matters, I'm fairly certain you can omit keys. Definitely omit any Fn keys, as those are passed directly to your keyboard, not the system. (defcfg) is where you configure Kmonad for your system, if you have a plugin keyboard it should be easiest to find under ""/dev/input/by-id"", if you have a laptop keyboard you'll find it under ""/dev/input/by-path"". (defsrcc) should be your keyboard layout as it exists, (defalias) is where your going to define the behavior of your alias keys that you re-map, the first (deflayer) is the main layer that Kmonad will apply when running, and any other (deflayer) can be accessed through alias re-mappings.

    (defcfg
      ;; For Linux

## Neovim Config

Now just add these mappings to your Neovim config and everything should be working.

    -- Vim Clutch
    map(""n"", ""&lt;F9&gt;"", ""a"", { desc = ""Vim Clutch"" })
    map(""i"", ""&lt;F9&gt;"", ""&lt;Esc&gt;"", { desc = ""Vim Clutch"" })
    map(""v"", ""&lt;F9&gt;"", ""&lt;Esc&gt;"", { desc = ""Vim Clutch"" })
    map(""c"", ""&lt;F9&gt;"", ""&lt;Esc&gt;"", { desc = ""Vim Clutch"" })

This is how I have it set up right now. There might be a better key to use than F9, but it seems to be working well so far. There's obviously a ton more here you can do with Kmonad, but I should probably get back to doing my homework.

**Edit:** Another quick note. I thought I'd share quickly how I got Kmonad to run as a service since it took me a minute. I took this [systemd service file](https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad/blob/master/startup/kmonad%40.service) from and modified it a bit. Partially because I wanted it to run the .kdb that was in my dotfiles folder, and frankly because I don't know exactly how ""%E/kmonad/%i.kbd"" is choosing which .kdb to use.

 Create this .service file and after editing the appropriate path for your .kdb (and obviously the path for Kmonad if you installed it elsewhere), save it in your systemd folder as kmonad.service:

    [Unit]
    Description=kmonad keyboard config
    
    [Service]
    Restart=always
    RestartSec=3
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/kmonad /home/YOUR_USER/.kmonad_desktop.kbd
    Nice=-20
    
    [Install]
    DefaultInstance=config
    WantedBy=default.target

Then just

    systemctl enable kmonad.service
    systemctl start kmonad.service",t3

The sequence of commands I'm using for example is

- ""%"" jump to closing brace paired with that open brace
- ""j"" move a line down

Hi everyone! I'm looking to get into vim. I'm a long-time VSCode user and consider myself pretty quick with it since I'm already used to a lot of shortcuts that I'm able to use only the keyboard 90% of the time. I don't even know where to start finding alternatives for them on NeoVim. As far as I know, NeoVim boasts it can do all the features but ""mouseless"", and that's really cool if I can learn those.

I tried the VSCode Vim extension and there were a lot of very difficult things to do (like even just opening and closing the sidebar). Maybe it's just the extension's bottleneck of having to support both Vim and VSCode features at once.

Because of that, I thought I should just jump into NeoVim right away. All I really know with vim so far are the ""hjkliweb"" keys. In order to cut my learning curve a bit, I'm hoping you guys could share your knowledge if you know any of the familiar features of VSCode on NeoVim:

* Ctrl + D (Selecting All Instances of a Selection in the file)
* Alt + Shift + ArrowKeys (Duplicate Up/Down)
* Ctrl + Tab (Switch to Last File Opened)
*  Ctrl + W (Close a File currently opened)
* Ctrl + B - (Opening and Closing Sidebar, immediate ick for me that it doesn't work with the VSCode Vim extension since I was so used to it, do you guys have an alternative way of browsing the file tree at least?)
* Ctrl + F (How do you guys search for text in files?)
* Ctrl + Shift + F (Find text in any file, I use this a LOT)
* Ctrl + Shift + O (Finds symbols in any language, like ""Find"" but jumps to different variable declarations, function declarations, etc. I don't use it a lot but might be useful).
* Ctrl + G (Go to line number)
* Ctrl + P (Find File Name)
* Ctrl + Shift + P (This is mostly just VSCode, but is there a bread-and-butter way to like search up commands on NeoVim)
* Shift + Alt + H (Show Call Hierarchy, list of which lines and files a particular function was called)
* Shift + Alt + F12 (Find All References, List of Files that use a particular variable/function)
* Extension: Git Graph (I use this VSCode extension almost extensively to navigate my commits on different branches, I can't imagine doing this on the terminal, but maybe I'll get used to it, how do you guys usually do it? I'm hoping it's not just \`git log\`).
* Extension: Git Lens (I usually only use this for seeing git blame per line, comparing files on a commit/branch basis, and a nice CLI for dropping/picking interactive rebase)

I'm working on creating a VIM-based educational game, and I'm looking for a library that can help me manage text navigation and implement VIM-like changes based on programatically provided input.

While one option is to build this functionality from scratch, I'm hoping to find an existing library that can save me from reinventing the wheel. I've attempted to dive into the VIM and pyvim source code, but they can be quite complex for me to decipher. I also spent some time looking at Python's prompt\_toolkit but couldn't figure out a way to achieve this.

One, illustrated below, produces a popup window of `buffers` or `buffers!`, which I find useful. The green annotation explains why.

Another, the `gA` popup window I particularly like. It displays lots of information about the character(s) under the cursor. So, e.g., if you want to know `ga` and/or `g8` information and maybe want to know the highlight group too.... Well, you'll get the value of this:

[gA](https://preview.redd.it/n4739xewkayb1.png?width=751&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c30ff8c3ee75600b2d57233a19293ed50daebf5)

The README and help files explain these, and the rest, in detail.

Popup windows don't get much airtime in r/vim. Whether that's because people don't know about/care about them, not many plugins use them, or whatever, I thought it was worth sharing this. (I'd built these over time in my .vimrc but, when tidying it, moved them to a plugin, so there you have it.)

More incidental points are that it has vim9script and vimscript covered (dependent on the version of Vim being used, though at least version 8.2 with patch 3434 is needed). That may be of interest to some of you too because it uses vim9-mix (though not using `if !has('vim9script')`).

(*Note, if you're a Neovim user, this form of popup window is unavailable because* `popup_*` *builtin functions are exclusive to Vim. That's happening more as their development diverges.*)",t3

I started from some existing code ([https://github.com/ettaka/vim-apdl](https://github.com/ettaka/vim-apdl)) and so far I have made some changes, but there is one issue I can't understand.

In APDL we have some multiline commands, meaning that after a command is called (`*msg`, for instance), the next line is presumed to be a format line (Fortran or C format are allowed). To syntax highlight this format line correctly I therefore need to look at the previous line, see if it's calling one of a few existing multiline commands.

What's currently happening is that this highlight is behaving in a weird way. If I pass through the format line with the cursor, the highlighting turns on (when going up with `k`) and off (when going down with `j`). See the gif below for a demonstration.

I wrote my first vim plugin you can check it out here:

[https://github.com/wnim/UVM-Log-Focus/](https://github.com/wnim/UVM-Log-Focus/) (The demo here might be clearer than the code)

Code:

[https://github.com/wnim/UVM-Log-Focus/blob/main/log.vim](https://github.com/wnim/UVM-Log-Focus/blob/main/log.vim)

For our purpose let's say that all that it does, is when I open a file that ends with `sim.log`, it opens another horizontal window (Named `SearchTerms`) and displays some information there.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't seem to get rid of 2 unwanted behaviors.

1. When I open a sim.log file that already has some content, I get this text from vim:

&amp;#x200B;

    ""SearchTerms"" [New]  
    4 fewer lines  
    press ENTER or type command to continue  

and I really wish I could get rid of this behaviour.This doesn't happen on every linux machine, only on some of them :/

&amp;#x200B;

2. The cursor starts on `SearchTerms` window instead of the ""sim.log"" windows

&amp;#x200B;

My attempt to solve issue ""2"" was to put inside the function `SetFoldexprWin` `wincmd w` which didn't work, or `execute(""normal \\&lt;C-w&gt;j"")` also didn't work.",t3

* `u` undoes the restore,
* `""1p` again brings back the same last line delete,

i‚Äôm confused because if you use `.`, which i understand repeats the last command, in place of `""1pu`, which would be the command repeated, it starts behaving differently and instead cycles through the last 9 line deletes. how does it know to bring back the second line delete the second time, the third one the third time, and so on?",t3

There's flag `-stdio`, so it should be now possible - as proven by Neovim plugin [sonarlint.nvim](https://gitlab.com/schrieveslaach/sonarlint.nvim).

So taking that plugin as an example, I've extracted the server from [SonarLint for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonarlint-vscode), created myself a wrapper:

    #!/usr/bin/env sh
    DIR=/path/to/extracted/extension
    java -jar ""$DIR""/server/sonarlint-ls.jar \
        -analyzers ""$DIR""/analyzers/* \
        ""$@""

And registered server in _vimrc_:

    if executable(""sonarlint-ls"")
      au User lsp_setup call lsp#register_server(#{
            \   name: ""SonarLint"",
            \   cmd: [ ""sonarlint-ls"", ""-stdio"" ],
            \   root_uri: {-&gt; lsp#utils#path_to_uri(
            \     lsp#utils#find_nearest_parent_file_directory(
            \       lsp#utils#get_buffer_path(),
            \       [ "".git/"" ]
            \     )
            \   )},
            \   allowlist: [ ""python"" ],
            \ })
    endif

So according to promo video [SonarLint for Python: How to Get Started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAz9O_N1Vs8) when opening Python file:

    def foo():
        a = 10
        b = 10
        print(a is b)

I should get a hint to replace `is` with `==`, but nothing happens, despite server running.

I never touched VIM before this year (gasp, I know) and didn't start getting decent at it til about a month ago. I can get around files decently, use substitutions, and a few other things, and slowly things are getting faster.

My new workplace REQUIRES VIM - as in the VMs we use for work don't have any other text editors loaded. We also are not allowed to modify configs (security reasons). It's regular VIM compiled without xterm clipboard support and also has mouse turned off (mouse= ). I CAN turn the mouse back on, but clipboard is a lost cause - and besides, insisting on mouse seems like it's missing the point.

Now here's the kicker: my job involves a LOT of copy-paste. I have to keep my work terminal and VIM terminal separate (no tabs, splitting, or multiplexing) - again for ""security purposes"". Like I can go through a few hundred commands in a couple of hours. If I had clipboard this would be super duper easy but as is... I find myself constantly having to take my hand off keyboard to shift-highlight shift-ctrl-c then mouse to my term and shift-ctrl-v.

I'm coming to terms with it but the added mental load of having to constantly shift gears from keyboard to k+m actually becomes draining after a while and I start making technical errors (dropping the wrong command in a term and having to start an hour of work all over again)

I have been researching different PKMS (personal knowledge management systems) to help me organize things both for my job and for my personal goals. The top contender for me is Vimwiki. The workflows I've seen on YouTube seem to be exactly what I'm looking for. One of my personal/career goals is to get into programming. I do operations management and I feel like it would be helpful to know how to engage with APIs or build scripts for reporting etc. 

So the additional incentive to use VimWiki instead of like Logseq or Obsidian or something is that it would also train some coding muscles.

My concern is I'm having a hard time even getting to install VimWiki into Vim. I ran through the tutorial and tried looking up some stuff within Vim in the manual but I still don't understand how to edit the options I'm seeing on Github so when I tried a couple of the ways to add the plugin it wasn't working.

Can anyone guide me on the actual install for VimWiki? I'm not seeing anything on YouTube that doesn't just glaze over half of it.

I feel like once I'm actually in VimWiki and maybe with some extra training wheel plugins I'll start getting comfortable and figuring stuff out on my own. The entry and setup is really throwing me for a loop right now though.

1799i4m,6,0.87,1,6,1821,278,2023-10-16T16:04:04Z,"Announcing [Imp](https://github.com/flwyd/vim-imp), a vim plugin to make it easy to add imports without breaking your flow.  It currently supports Java, Kotlin, ES6 (JavaScript/TypeScript), Python, PHP, and Bazel; support for several other languages is planned.  Imp is based on the assumption that the import you want probably exists elsewhere in your code base, so search around and suggest the most popular options for a symbol.  The modular and plugin-based approach enables developers to add other languages, integrate with a private code search system, or otherwise extend the functionality without writing a complete import management plugin.  The plugin uses some fancy regular expressions and does not require an LSP.

Java programmers will be familiar with the problem this plugin solves.  You're writing some new code and declare a `List` variable, but it won't compile until you add an import statement to declare which `List` you mean.  Jumping to the top of the file, typing out a whole import statement, and moving back to the code you were writing is disruptive, and you might not remember the fully qualified name anyway.  So just type `:ImpSuggest List` and Imp will present some options:

```
import java.util.List;
import java.awt.List;
import com.lowagie.text.List;
import com.example.api.MyService.Method.List;
```

The list will be sorted by the frequency it occurs in your code base (which could be ""the whole repo"", ""the same directory"", ""open buffers"", or some other set of files), and if it's the first time you've imported that symbol it will prompt you for a statement.  If there's only one option it'll insert it right away, or you can use `:ImpFirst` to insert the most popular match automatically.  There's lots more documentation at https://github.com/flwyd/vim-imp and `:help imp-intro`.",t3

1760eud,2,1.0,5,2,1702,230,2023-10-12T06:42:42Z,"Currently, my `.clang-format` file at the root of the project is like so:

    Standard: Cpp11
    BasedOnStyle: LLVM
    IndentWidth: 4
    TabWidth: 4
    UseTab: ""Always""
    ColumnLimit: 0
    AccessModifierOffset: -4
    NamespaceIndentation: All
    BreakBeforeBraces: Attach

Within `.vimrc`, I have

`autocmd FileType c,cpp,h,hpp setlocal equalprg=clang-format` in the hope that `gg=G` will format my current buffer based on my `.clang-format` file.

My current buffer is currently like so (`main.cpp`) and remains unchanged after `gg=G` indicating that it is consistent with the format file.:

	#include &lt;iostream&gt;
	#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

	int main(){
		printf(""Hello world\n"");
		getchar();
	}

This, unfortunately, does not allow usage of vim shortcuts `[[` and `]]` to navigate to beginning of current and next function respectively. That seems to need the file to be formatted like so:

	#include &lt;iostream&gt;
	#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

	int main()
    {
		printf(""Hello world\n"");
		getchar();
	}

Where the opening `{` and closing `}` of the function are on separate lines.

Note, within a function, I would still like to have `for/while` loops or `if` conditions, like so:

    for(int i = 1; i &lt; 10;i++){

instead of 

    while(a &lt; b)
    {

What changes are needed in the `.clang-format` file to accomplish this automatically whenever I run `gg=G`? Are there any other formats that are useful for other Vim functionalities?

----

E: Just found out it works with `BrakeBeforeBraces: Linux`. Documentation [here](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormatStyleOptions.html).
If there are other useful formats that make applying Vim shortcuts easier, please do comment.",t3

**1 month update:** started using Neovim, I don't know even 1% of it. Curently reading the official Bram Moolenar's (RIP) Vim guide 15 minutes a day. Wrote a bubble sort function in C, very nice. Though no LaTeX+VimTex (plugins are too daunting yet). For the Linux I go through NDG linux essentials (I currently only know how to move files around)

**2 month update (sorry for getting off-topic):** I understood that my primary problem is not being able to use GNU/Linux properly and now my full focus is on learning it and only after that Vim/Nvim. Completed half of the NDG's 100 hours course. Can now fully replace GUI file manager with CLI :)",t3

I use vim/neovim as my main editor for a few years now. I love it.
But what I can't get over is that as soon as you press colon (:) you kind of fall out of vim, as in you can't paste whatever you yanked with p, you can't move with hjkl, you don't have modes. 
I understand that you can circumvent all of that, which I do, like copying to the + buffer, so i can paste with ctrl+shift+v and using arrows to navigate inside the line, but it seems kinda jarring every time.
What i wanna know is am I the only one who is annoyed by this or is there a workaround that I am missing or something",t3
