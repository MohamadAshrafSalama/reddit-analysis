Previously I used anaconda to manage my environments and I was hoping to do the same in emacs. I am using a macos with emacs 29 installed. I realized that eglot and treesitter come with emacs 29 so I have been using the default settings that it suggested when I opened a python file and ran eglot.

But there were a couple things I am trying to figure out and whether I am following a good approach.

1. I have added a hook to ensure that eglot always turns on when I open a python file or c file, but this does not happen with the hooks added in my init.el file. I always have to run eglot once I open the file.
2. To run my python file, I use M-x compile and then it auto populates ""make -k"" and I have to delete it and rewrite ""python myfile.py"" in the minibuffer. I am wondering if this is the most efficient approach to running python files or cpp files in emacs29?

18hxs9a,43,1.0,17,43,5310,532,2023-12-14T02:09:05Z,"&gt;Let's create an Emacs Advent calendar! It would be nice if for every day till Christmas someone takes the opportunity to showcase their Emacs work. It will be interesting to see what you are all working on.

Thanks u/minad-emacs for the prompting.  Some Emacs packages I've worked on recently.

## Major packages

* [vundo](https://github.com/casouri/vundo) \[1\]: the fabulous *visual undo* by u/casouri (undo-tree power with the standard emacs undo system).  This year I added visualization for saved states in the undo tree, and more recently, powerful mark+diff functionality.
* [indent-bars](https://github.com/jdtsmith/indent-bars) \[2\]: recently introduced; fast and highly customizable indentation bars using stipples, with treesitter support.
* [kind-icon](https://github.com/jdtsmith/kind-icon): SVG icons for completion; pairs perfectly with [corfu](https://github.com/minad/corfu).  Recently added transparent icon backgrounds as the new default.
* [mlscroll](https://github.com/jdtsmith/mlscroll): a fast, line-based proportional scrollbar for your mode line (works in terminal too). Recently updated to behave better with changing themes.
* [org-modern-indent](https://github.com/jdtsmith/org-modern-indent): `org-modern`\-like block ""bracket"" style with `org-indent`.
* [outli](https://github.com/jdtsmith/outli): self-configuring outline helper with good styling and org-like quick keys for fast navigating, inserting new headings, folding/unfolding, and more.  Try `h` on a heading!
* [python-mls](https://github.com/jdtsmith/python-mls): multi-line shell commands with history, seamless in-shell editing, and easy navigation for (i)python.
* [speedrect](https://github.com/jdtsmith/speedrect): a convenient modal interface for the builtin `rectangle-mark-mode`, with quick keys, round tripping data to `calc`, and more.  Recently updated to preserve the rectangle and restart itself after most commands, so you can quickly mark, open, delete, yank, calculate, insert, etc.

## Small utilities

* [mode-minder](https://github.com/jdtsmith/mode-minder): a simple tool to discover all the major and minor modes you have installed, and the hierarchical relationships between them.
* [consult-jump-project](https://github.com/jdtsmith/consult-jump-project): a small [consult](https://github.com/minad/consult)\-based tool for switching among `project.el` projects.  Most well known for its color-coded ""project age"" listing.
* [abridge-diff](https://github.com/jdtsmith/abridge-diff): abridge cumbersome diffs of long-line files (like those using `visual-line-mode`) to focus on the true (refined) changes.  Works with magit too.
* [comint-fold](https://github.com/jdtsmith/comint-fold): fold input/output blocks in any comint-based (shell) mode using `hideshow`.

## Mac packages

These are for the fantastic [emacs-mac](https://bitbucket.org/mituharu/emacs-mac) port.

* [ultra-scroll-mac](https://github.com/jdtsmith/ultra-scroll-mac) \[3\]: an ultra high performance smooth scrolling mode for the emacs-mac build which can keep up with the very high event rates of modern trackpads, and scroll across tall images without a hitch.
* [org-mac-image-paste](https://github.com/jdtsmith/org-mac-image-paste): paste images and PDFs from the Mac clipboard directly into org documents as attachments, with automatic support for Retina displays.

## Notes

* \[1\]: Diff works between any states you can reach in the undo history, whether saved or not.  One powerful workflow: mark current node, navigate to older saved state, diff.  You can save undo history with [undo-fu-session](https://github.com/emacsmirror/undo-fu-session).
* \[2\]: Note that the ancient *stipple* feature has uneven support among modern Emacs builds (\~50/50, possibly due to disuse).  Box characters are also supported, and work in the terminal as well.
* \[3\]: Uses special scroll-event information available only in `emacs-mac`, but the core algorithm should be usable in `pixel-scroll-precision-mode`.  Once the dust clears on some Emacs [display](https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=67533) [bugs](https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=67604) `ultra-scroll-mac` revealed, these will be contributed upstream.

Hope you're all well.

I have my org-block background set to a custom color, and I've only just now noticed that for html and js org code blocks, tree-sitter is screwing up some of the highlighting

Specifically it's highlighting punctuation weirdly, because the face `tree-sitter-hl-face:punctuation.delimiter`, `tree-sitter-hl-face:punctuation.bracket`, etc. are set to inherit `default` instead of `org-block`.

Here's an example, along with a `describe-face` for the text in question.

18hfso2,131,0.95,40,131,3114,528,2023-12-13T12:32:48Z,"Let start with having some content: the Helm package belongst to the most popular Emacs packages. The author, Thierry Volpiatto, was struggling between his family and financial commitments and his work to maintain and extend the Helm package with all the developments in Emacs community. He called for help for 2 years but he couldn't find anyone who could take it over and kept asking for 2 years. The author is not even a programmer, but a mountain guide in France as his daily job to provide his family an income. 
With all the work for Emacs community, Thierry was burned out and decided to stop with the Helm development because of the lack of any support from the Helm users. He was forced to [make the decision](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/issues/2083) to stall the maintenance of Helm. Sacha Chua dedice to ask Thierry Volpiatto more about his work for her blog. You can read the interview **[back here](https://sachachua.com/blog/2018/09/interview-with-thierry-volpiatto/)**

The interview prompted some users here to donate to him, to encourage him to keep maintaining and extending Helm. With all the contributions, Thierry decided to do it again with the Helm development and maintenance. When there was a Paetron hack, Thierry Volpiatto was worried about the safety of the data and how Paetron was charging his contributors with high fees. This made him to switch to open source alternative LiberaPay. But nobody joined him there. Later Paetron made some changes, which made Thierry to switch back to Paetron a year ago, with a new account. But the donators were not coming back. Perhaps they couldn't find his Paetron yet? We don't know. It's a costly mistake given the loss of donators. 

To put some things into perspective, the Emacs' Helm development and maintenance is being kept by him as only maintainer for nearly every day/week in the last 11 years.

Another thing to put in perspective: the Magit maintainer received a starting fund of $73,000 to enable him to work full-time on Magit for a whole year. On top of that, more than **600** people pledge to donate monthly to him. The monthly donation amount is not clear, but it could be around $2,000 or more to him every month.

And Thierry, not even 10 donators. Perhaps could you consider to donate for Helm development? And you don't even have to donate $5 monthly, but you could also adjust the amount that you want to donate on Paetron, to not only $5, but even $1 per month or $3 per month. Or only one donation of $1?
I have registered on Patreon and donating $3 each month now. $3 dollars, that's an amount you're already spending with a small part of groceries each day, if not more. Let alone $3 every month. Or just a cup of coffee to give to him? 

If you, and other 50 users would be reading this post now, and did the same thing, then we could be be done in 1 day and Thierrry could happily continue with the Helm development.

Please **[consider to donate as a way to support the overall Emacs ecosystem and Thierry Volpattio to keep it up with Helm](https://www.patreon.com/user/posts?u=86324343)**. Thanks in advance!",t3

I imagine there is some setting in org 9.7 where I can change something like the max width allowed so that reasonably sized tables that need to show up side by side do so, as opposed to getting automatically stacked.

Also, I am using org-fragtog (is there a way to auto-toggle without it) in order to toggle the previews automatically when I step into them, however, I think the behavior is too 'eager'. What I mean by this is that as soon as point goes over the preview, it disappears and shows the tex fragment. Is there a way to emulate auctex's latex preview here? In other words, I want the preview to turn into text only when I C-f or C-b from the sides into it, but if I C-n or C-p from above or below, it should remain an image.

When I am in an org file and invoke `M-x` and start typing the letter ""o"" (thereby selecting one of the many ""org"" functions in the `M-x` menu), I immediately get a pop up with the following warning:

```elisp
⛔ Warning (org-element): ‘org-element-at-point’ cannot be used in non-Org buffer
```
[EDIT] some additional details:

1. I don't get this issue when I am in a non-org-mode buffer, nor do I get the issue if I try to type any other letter.
1. Upon further inspection, the issue also arises when the first option in the `M-x` menu is something like `org-mode` (e.g. because I recently activated it). So the mere fact that the selected item in the `M-x` menu is something with org-mode triggers the issue.

Searching around, it appears to be caused by some changes in Org 9.7(-pre). Reverting back to 9.6 resolves the problem.

Whilst I have ""solved"" the problem for myself now, I was wondering where would be the best place to report this issue?

I am aware of similar issues being raised already (e.g. for [org-ql](https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql/issues/364) and [org-roam](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/issues/2391)), but I'm not entirely sure whether my issue arises from these packages (although I do use them both).",t3

I've working for the past couple of days on a [tree-sitter based major mode for TLA+](https://github.com/Davidbrcz/tla-ts-mode).

From Wikipedia
&gt; TLA+ is a formal specification language developed by Leslie Lamport [*the La of Latex*] It is used for designing, modelling, documentation, and verification of programs, especially concurrent systems and distributed systems. 

And PlusCal 
&gt;  PlusCal (formerly called +CAL) is a formal specification language, which transpiles to TLA+. PlusCal most resembles an imperative programming language

The mode offers syntax highlighting for most TLA+ / PlusCal Syntax, and basic imenu navigation. Code formatting is work in progress (TLA+ having significant indendation is in my point of view a significant challenge).


Any feedback is welcome.

The work is inspired by [tla-mode](https://github.com/carlthuringer/tla-mode), and [this page ](https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/lets-write-a-treesitter-major-mode) has been an invaluable help.

Hurl is a cli tool for sending HTTP requests (using cURL under the hood) in plain text format similar to [https://github.com/pashky/restclient.el](https://github.com/pashky/restclient.el) but can be used outside emacs and also has some additional testing utilities built in.

I've switched from vim to emacs recently with evil mode. It's been a great experience so far however, I'm facing an issue with js2-mode syntax highlighting. I appreciate that web-mode is designed for mixed syntax files, if you're say working with templates for front-end web-dev, however I have found it provides far superior syntax highlighting than js2-mode. I haven't noticed any other difference between js2-mode and web-mode apart from this, I guess I've only scratched the surface. I primarily work with js and json files for node.js back-end development and only touch front-end, where I guess web-mode would be excellent a minority of the time. The error highlighting seems to be same for both, driven by lsp-mode. I haven't touched ESlint yet (been using ts-ls so far), only just installed it.

I guess my questions boil down to:

Why should I use 1 over the other especially given the syntax highlighting preference?

How does flycheck / flymake play into this, what are the differences?

Is it fine to run 2 language servers for lsp-mode / how does that work? Using lsp-describe-session shows both of them running?

As a side-note does anyone have a config with lsp-ui and peek that they're willing share for some inspiration / things I've missed.

I also have tern running is this required?

Thank you in advance.

When issues pertaining to multithreading inevitably came up in a talk, I made a low-brow passing comment about an ""Emacs-STM"" fork. It was meant to be tongue-in-cheek, but karma has it that this mind virus has now caught hold of my thoughts. Not the *fork* part of course, but definitely the *STM* part.

If we take a longer view, say multi-decade (""*the next 40 years*""), do we expect the collaborative form we have now to be the ultimate resolution? I ask because some would readily dismiss the topic altogether, whereas a longer-term view may induce looking beyond the more urgent and immediate, I would think.

Plus, it seems we could *have our cake and eat it too*. On one side, we could maintain the illusion of single-threadness and its simplification of the reasoning about our programs and state we like so much. It would likely imply having *implicit transactions* so as to not have to change any of the code out there. On the other side, well, thread-safety and concurrency ""*for free*"", with always-responsive UIs, lesser need to fork out to external/inferior processes, etc. This is not mutually exclusive with collaborative forms and CSP style primitives when warranted obviously, I just mean to isolate the *STM-as-a-silver-bullet* part of the discussion here.

In the modern world of performant functional/immutable data structures, CRDTs for this and that, and the likes, there are some interesting tools in the arsenal to make concurrency management and conflict resolution a more workable thing nowadays. Also, the fact that things work currently suggest we could get away with *optimistic* defaults to some extent, so performance impacts could possibly be minimized. There's also been a few interesting reference implementations making it into the mainstream and exploring different directions in the tradeoff space, from Clojure to Haskell and the Cardano/Plutus ecosystem just to name a few.

Surprisingly, there is quite a dearth of literature and discussion around the topic with respect to Emacs/Elisp specifically - from formal publications to the mailing list and forums like these (r/emacs, Emacs SE, EmacsWiki, etc.), other than a few decade-old mentions by Stefan, John, and others, and insights shared by Tom and others as part of the fantastic work underlying the collaborative concurrency we \**do*\* have today, and things like *async.el*. For those interested, “[Evolution of Emacs Lisp](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3386324)” has an interesting historical survey section about it.

I'm no Rich Hickey myself, and even that comparative association is unwarranted, but I've nonetheless dabbled in implementing low-level concurrency management in contexts where idempotency and low-latency intersect. From this albeit limited perspective, I'm inclined to think that if concurrency and multi-threading beyond the cooperative kind are to be part of Emacs/Elisp's future at all, there's an interesting case to be made for STM, and that it might just be practical nowadays. I'm well aware that STMs have had a few hype cycles at this point, but I think it's fair to say things have evolved substantially in that last decade to possibly warrant reopening the discussion. I'm also painfully aware that this cross-cuts many parts of the codebase, and that though there are a few centralized hotspots around variable mutation and otherwise this represents merely a drop in the bucket...

I don't intend to do more than investigate further for the time being, but these are a few recurring thoughts, in the aforementioned spirit of idea sharing.

Would anyone care to present the best counterarguments against some form of STM making it into Emacs/Elisp at some point, as a longer-term solution? Or any other critiques, insights, or ideas for that matter.

clangd (C++ LSP server) is over-aggressive about adding ""helpful"" `#include`s during completion. The way to [turn that off](https://github.com/clangd/clangd/issues/55) is to pass `-header-insertion=never` on its cmd line.

In eglot with recent trunk emacs, the C-related modes are configured by default like this, in `eglot-server-programs`:
```
                                ((c-mode c-ts-mode c++-mode c++-ts-mode)

So I could splice that out and replace it, for sure. But then I lose the alternative of using `ccls` if that's what's installed, and it seems fragile with all the `ts-` stuff happening these days. So my question is, is there a way to configure eglot to say ""when invoking clangd, always pass `-header-insertion=never`? And if not, would that be a useful addition?

Judging by popularity, my most useful packages are:

* [devdocs.el](https://github.com/astoff/devdocs.el): Documentation reader with quick and handy lookup commands.  It is similar to the built-in Info reader, but has a different (likely larger) document coverage.
* [code-cells](https://github.com/astoff/code-cells.el): Utilities to work with “lightweight notebooks”, that is, source code which is split into cells by special `%%` comments.  Also allows you to transparently edit Jupyter notebook (ipynb) files.

Combined with the above, these two packages can help setting up a nice Python editing environment (although there's nothing Python-specific about them):

* [buffer-env](https://github.com/astoff/buffer-env): A pure-Elisp version of the [direnv](https://direnv.net/) utility.  Useful to make Emacs aware of Python virtualenvs (which, judging by the questions posted here, is unfortunately still a complication for a lot of people).  Similar to (and inspired by) [envrc](https://github.com/purcell/envrc), but doesn't require the direnv program.
* [comint-mime](https://github.com/astoff/comint-mime): Adds graphical capabilities to the Python shell (matplotlib, etc.).  It's extensible and can be made to work with other Comint modes.

The following fall under under the rubric of “improvements of built-in features”.

* [isearch-mb](https://github.com/astoff/isearch-mb): A subtle modification to isearch (`C-s` and friends) giving it a more “normal” feel by today's standards.  Basically, allows you to edit the search string while searching.  Similar to [ctrlf](https://github.com/radian-software/ctrlf), but less invasive of a change, and arguably more robust.
* [jit-spell](https://github.com/astoff/jit-spell): Alternative to Flyspell which operates asynchronously and checks the entire screen (not just words you just typed).  Similar to u/minad's [jinx](https://github.com/minad/jinx) (which is in fact a fork of jit-spell); jinx runs the spell-checker synchronously inside Emacs via a C module, while jit-spell uses an asynchronous subprocess.
* [dREPL](https://github.com/astoff/drepl): An attempt, rather experimental at this point, to improve deficiencies of the Python shell such as limited completion and lack of multi-line input editing.  It's actually a REPL protocol geared towards dumb terminals (which is what Emacs looks like from the perspective of its subprocesses), so it's actually not limited to Python and can be used to create other fully-featured shells.
* [unicode-math-input](https://github.com/astoff/unicode-math-input.el): Input method like the built-in `TeX`, but with complete coverage of Unicode math symbols.

Last but not least:

* [plz-see](https://github.com/astoff/plz-see.el): Interactive HTTP client, similar to [restclient](https://github.com/pashky/restclient.el) and [verb](https://github.com/federicotdn/verb), but using Elisp instead of a special text-based syntax.

Magit is one of the most incredible tools available but it is frustratingly slow on big git repos, especially when they're located on a slow file system. I very often find myself giving 2-3 commands in a row and only seeing the output in a few seconds.

E.g. I'd type (1) `f u` to fetch all, then (2) `r e` to trigger rebase elsewhere and then start typing (3) `/mast` so the counsel wrapper can find `origin/master` and then I press Enter. I basically do all steps (1)-(3) and will only see any output &gt;5s later.

This definitely breaks the workflow and I would at least expect Emacs not to freeze between inputs (1), (2) and (3) and just give me clues that there's a process running in background.

Is it something possible or should I try to use some optimisation tricks to do less on every magit operation?

Thanks everyone who submitted the data!

I have now summarized everything.
You can find the analysis in my EmacsConf2023 presentation -
https://emacsconf.org/2023/talks/gc/ and
https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10213384 (reproducible analysis).

The key takeaways from the above analysis:

For users:

1. Emacs freezes due to GC are real
2. … but not for all users
3. When GC does get Emacs slower, it is either
     - slow startup ⇒ increase `gc-cons-threshold` to 20-80Mb check
	`gc-elapsed` after startup
     - slow and frequent GC ⇒ increase `gc-cons-percetage` to 0.2-1.0
	but watch Emacs RAM usage


For Emacs devs:


1. GC problem is very real for many users (9% of GCs are both frequent
     and slow)
2. It is worth bumping `gc-cons-threshold` temporarily during startup
3. Ideally, we should switch from Mark&amp;Sweep to something more
     performant
4. May increase `gc-cons-percetage`, but need to get user data for
     optimal numbers

Further plans:

1. With the collected data we can hopefully continue emacs-devel
   discussion on changing GC defaults and get somewhere.
   https://yhetil.org/emacs-devel/20230310110747.4hytasakomvdyf7i@Ergus/

2. emacs-gc-stats package has now served its purpose, but I think that
   it might still be useful for people who want to toy around GC
   settings. I plan to add some kind of ""session summary"" command that
   will display the key statistics of current user session. It should
   help understanding the effects of GC customization on the performance.",t3

By far my three most popular packages are:

- [orderless](https://github.com/oantolin/orderless). A highly configurable completion style that matches multiple patterns in any order against minibuffer completion candidates.
- [embark](https://github.com/oantolin/embark). The one I always struggle to explain, so instead go read u/karthink's [wonderful blog post](https://karthinks.com/software/fifteen-ways-to-use-embark/) about it! Prodded by u/minad-emacs, I just released version 1.0! 🎉 
- [marginalia](https://github.com/minad/marginalia). Informative annotations for minibuffer completion candidates, co-written with u/minad-emacs.

Packages I haven't put on MELPA or GNU ELPA, but I know some people use:

- [math-delimiters](https://github.com/oantolin/math-delimiters). Provides a nice command to insert LaTeX math delimiters and to toggle between inline and display versions of them.
- [placeholder](https://github.com/oantolin/placeholder). On the fly ephemeral snippets: need to send a bunch of similar emails just this once so you don't want to bother making a skeleton, tempo or yasnippet template for them? Use placeholder!
- [epithet](https://github.com/oantolin/epithet). Give descriptive names to buffers.

Tiny, tiny packages in my personal configuration that I think someone may want to steal:

- [block-undo](https://github.com/oantolin/emacs-config/blob/master/my-lisp/block-undo.el). Have keyboard macros undo in a single step (something vi gets right!).
- [ffap-eshell](https://github.com/oantolin/emacs-config/blob/master/my-lisp/ffap-eshell.el). Make ffap correctly guess in more cases the directory containing a file name you find in an eshell buffer.
- [shr-heading](https://github.com/oantolin/emacs-config/blob/master/my-lisp/shr-heading.el). Navigate between headings in an eww buffer (or more generally, shr buffer), also enables imenu.
- [eval-region-advice](https://github.com/oantolin/emacs-config/blob/master/my-lisp/eval-region-advice.el). Advise evaluation commands to evaluate the region if active.

Finally, something useless which I've found fun (but haven't grown as much as I thought I would):

- [luggage](https://github.com/oantolin/luggage). A Largely Undesired Gadget: a Generative Art Gallery for Emacs.

I can, using `org-mime`, compose HTML emails if I need to. I also can view HTML emails using xwidgets. And I can attach the HTML email to an outgoing message using `mu4e-action-capture-message` and `mu4e-compose-attach-captured-message`. But is there a way to make the HTML content of the original email so that it's rendered inline as it were? (Sorry, I'm not sure I got the terminology right here...)

I tried looking at the raw message I capture with `mu4e-action-capture-message`, thinking I might be able to (a) open that file, (b) find the HTML content I need, and (c) insert it as an html part. But I didn't have much luck. (For one thing, the HTML bit of the raw email doesn't render the same as the original one somehow.) 

I'm close to a sort of working solution, by just replacing `disposition=attachment` with `disposition=inline` in the output of calling `mu4e-compose-attach-captured-message`. But I feel like I don't quite understand what I'm doing and would appreciate any pointers or suggestions.

(I've searched around and found a few discussions of issues related to this, but nothing there seemed to help with my particular issue---there's an issue at the `mu` repo which prompted me to use the capture+attach workflow I mentioned above, but that's the closest I've got to an answer so far...)

*EDIT*: the following sort of does the job, but it probably doesn't cover all the cases (what if, e.g. the original message also has an attachment?) and I'm sure there must be a more elegant solution to this, but I guess it's a start?

all good iam really happy just to get to this point.
##but 
as anyone who have maintain journal in datetree can understand that this file can be too long to navigate. so i wrote a simple function that 
1. go to a journal file
2. open current date / create if not existed
3. and narrow the subtree to that heading only so 

```
(defun my/goto-today-journal-entry ()
  ""Go to today's journal entry in the datetree and narrow to subtree.""

☝️ Following u/minad-emacs' cue, here's some stuff I've worked on.

**""Apps"" for Emacs:**

- [elfeed-tube](https://github.com/karthink/elfeed-tube): Youtube integration for Elfeed -- ""live"" transcripts, imenu support and more for Youtube subscriptions.
- [wombag](https://github.com/karthink/wombag): A Wallabag client for Emacs.  Wallabag is a read-it-later service.
- [gptel](https://github.com/karthink/gptel): An LLM chat client for Emacs, supports ChatGPT and local LLMs (via Ollama, GPT4All or llama.cpp)

**Packages that make using Emacs more convenient:**

- [popper](https://github.com/karthink/popper): Summon, dismiss or cycle through ""popup"" buffers.  Like drop-down terminals (guake, yakuake etc) but in Emacs and for any buffer, not just shells.

Find-file: /ssh:host: path/to/file

Find-file:/ssh:host:

It has lights on all the keys and it doesn't even have Caps Lock and Num Lock indicators as all the keys are lit. If there is a way to indicate the status of the  Caps Lock and Num Lock keys I'm yet to discover it.

There are other similar types whose light patterns programmable, but on this one they appear to be permamently lit.

It seems that the keyboard vendors charge a hefty premium for a ""gaming"" keyboard with a UK layout, and my view is that if I have to reprogram the keyboard whether UK or US then I might as well stick to the cheaper US one and reprogram it.

I got this one for all of £7.99 in baby pink because I could use the color therapy and I love the tactile feedback. I'm not sure how it will last though because one of the keys came off easily.

UK keyboards have a smaller Left-Shift key with the key for `\` and `|` next to it, before the `Z`, and on this keyboard  `\` is activated by `Alt-Shift -` and `|` is activated by `Alt-``, below the `ESC` key.

I want to use `Alt-=` for the `|` key to keep it closer. Currently pressing `Alt-=` produces nothing until it is pressed again after which it produces `¸`, some kind of tiny right-angled character.

I have read a few guides which are general and are targetted for Linux from bottom up, but I'd prefer something Emacsy if there is one, and if EXWM requires additional consideration.

 PS. I got another even smaller one in baby blue with 61 keys which I also need to program, but that may have to wait, and boy I never had a glimmer of what Emacs pinky could feel like until I tried to use the basic navigation keys which require the `Function` and `Alt` keys to activate them.",t3

```
(use-package gnus
  :ensure nil

  (gnus-select-method '(nnnil nil))
  (gnus-summary-exit-hook 'gnus-summary-expire-articles)
  (gnus-secondary-select-methods

               (nnmail-expiry-target ""nnimap+mymail:Trash"")
               (nnmail-expiry-wait immediate)))
```

In particular I want messages to expire immediately and be moved into my Trash folder. When I am inside a group summary, I can manually mark messages as Expired with `E`. Then I could manually expire them with `B e` or `M-x gnus-summary-expire-articles`. When I exit the summary buffer the messages appear in the Trash folder as expected. However I also have the `gnus-summary-exit-hook` set to call the same function. This configuration is actually unnecessary since that is the default setting. When I just exit the summary buffer, I see `Expiring articles...done` . . . but they aren't moved to the Trash folder. 

I am pretty confused by this behavior as I see no difference between the two invocations of `gnus-summary-expire-articles`. My config is also almost a mirror of most recent GNUS guides/configurations so I feel like I must be missing something simple or everyone else would experience the same behavior.

Has anyone else had this issue?

UPDATE

After much fiddling it seems the proper form is to use `gnus-exit-group-hook` so the working config would look something like:

```
(use-package gnus
  :ensure nil
  :custom
  (gnus-select-method '(nnnil nil))

So far I've only succeeded by doing the following:
- Move my custom elisp to a new file (emacs-lib.el) which starts with `(provide 'emacs-lib)`
- Manually run emacs-lisp-native-compile-and-load while visiting that file
- Change my init file to load the library:

    (setq elisp-dir ""~/config/elisp"")
    (add-to-list 'load-path elisp-dir)
    (require 'emacs-lib)

After restarting Emacs, I've checked that many of my custom functions are indeed native-compiled.

So far, I have written a couple functions to grab individual properties and grab all properties, then a wrapper that uses completing-read to let me pick a headline and return all properties. Currently, that wrapper only lets me search by headline, because I'm using completing-read to grab the headline then feeding that headline into my ""get-all-properties"" function. 

I've been trying (and failing) to find a way to search by property as well as headline - i.e. If I have headline 'A', 'B', and 'C' with property ':GROUP:' equal to 'test' , and 'D', 'E', and 'F' with ':GROUP:' equal to 'answer', I want to show the list of headlines as usual (A,B,C,D,E,F) but type 'test' into the minibuffer, and narrow the options down to just A B and C. 

The closest option to this that I found was the 'alt-completing-read' function (defined more [here](https://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/alt-completing-read.html)) but that only seems to let you search by the first element in the alist, not the second.

alphapapa, tarsius, and I just released `v0.3.0` of [hyperdrive.el](https://ushin.org/hyperdrive/hyperdrive-manual.html)!

======&gt; Prot and I are [presenting the new features at EmacsConf tomorrow](https://emacsconf.org/2023/talks/hyperdrive/)! &lt;======

Highlights of `v0.3.0`:

- Added a new interface to `hyperdrive-mirror` which uses new features from [Transient v0.5.0](https://emacsair.me/2023/11/28/transient-0.5/)
- Redesigned the `*hyperdrive-mirror*` buffer to use [taxy-magit-section](https://github.com/alphapapa/taxy.el/tree/package/taxy-magit-section)
- Added support for starting and stopping `hyper-gateway` from within Emacs on machines without `systemd`
- Add customization options for displaying hyperdrives using `format-spec`

Some more goodies:

- Basic Embark integration
- `find-file-at-point` integration
- Support following relative links in hyperdrive markdown files
- Internally, `hyperdrive.el` now uses `shorthands.el`

For the full set of changes, please check out the [hyperdrive.el CHANGELOG](https://ushin.org/hyperdrive/hyperdrive-changelog.html).

By the time the talk airs, `v0.3.0` should be available on [NonGNU ELPA](https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/hyperdrive.html) and [MELPA](https://melpa.org/#/hyperdrive)!

I am an American living with my family in Slovakia. I conduct my work and professional life in English, but find that I often need to intersperse Slovak words into my text. I have issues with the many current methods for entering diacritics and accented characters:

* Because I spend most of my time using English, I don't want to switch input methods back and forth from Slovak just for single words.
* I find the `C-x 8` maps for entering individual diacritics and accent marks a bit too cumbersome. To use it, one must think about which accent mark you want before you type the character, and for each type of diacritic, one must use a different key binding. 
* Finally, as a Windows user, I often use [Holdkey](https://www.holdkey.eu/) outside of Emacs, which provides a menu of diacritic options when I hold down an alphabet character (MacOS also has similar functionality built in). This works reasonably well, but I still find it to be too slow when typing a lot of hybrid English-Slovak text.

To address my needs of a non-modal solution for intermittently entering diacritics and accent marks without having to learn a lot of key-bindings, I developed Cyclekey:

[https://github.com/shankar2k/cyclekey](https://github.com/shankar2k/cyclekey)

Cyclekey requires invoking primarily a single command `cyclekey-cycle`, and thus only needs one key-binding (in my setup I use `M-o`).  Using Cyclekey, one can use this command to cycle through relevant keybindings for the character at point.

For example, suppose Cyclekey is configured to include Spanish and German, and we wish to type the following text:

    ﻿I went to a Mexican café in Düsseldorf and ordered jalapeño salsa.

* To enter ""café"", we type `c a f e M-o`
* To enter ""Düsseldorf"", we type `D u M-o M-o s s e l d o r f`
* To enter jalapeño, we type `j a l a p e n M-o o`

Languages can be added and removed dynamically to and from Cyclekey, and (by default) persist across sessions.

I hope some of you find this package useful! ",t3

I've been using neovim for awhile but have been increasingly frustrated with not being able to understand how things work when they break down. Hoping to learn emacs for fun and maybe to even replace/improve my nvim workflows.

Things went well at first. I followed the tutorial and got used to some basic navigation as well as window and buffer navigation. I LOVE being able to \`C-h\` for functions, keys, and variables.

I decided it was time to start trying to configure things and installing packages. I'm not patient enough to watch 10 hours of system crafters videos and didn't really want to buy Mastering Emacs, so I decided to do some googling and figure things out myself. I came across a guide with some basic starting points and was feeling good about things until I got to this part: [https://medium.com/@suvratapte/configuring-emacs-from-scratch-use-package-c30382297877](https://medium.com/@suvratapte/configuring-emacs-from-scratch-use-package-c30382297877)

**I am completely unable to install use-package and that feels pretty defeating**. I followed the instructions and the package was not found. I tried \`package-refresh-contents\` and found use-package-hydra use-package-chords and use-package-el-get. Can't seem to find use-package.

After some googling I thought it might be that my mac-homebrew-installed version of emacs was missing TLS support, so I deleted it, pulled the emacs-mac repo, and installed it with no issues. Started up my new install and had to navigate the fact that my alt key was no longer bound and my command key was magically mapped to meta which I don't want. It was really frustrating to run into this and have no idea how to C-h my way out of it. I managed to map alt to meta and map command to super, but not I can't command-c any more which is an annoyance.

On top of this, I still can't install use-package, the exact same thing happens. I deleted the part of my config that sets up melpa and used the instructions from their site. I confirmed using eww that I have TLS support working. I tried a number of commands from reddit and elsewhere and have not made any progress. I feel like I'm back in my vim config hopelessly adding lines to my config until it's not broken.

Primarily I need help passing this hurdle so that I can try and set things up myself. It would also be super nice to understand why these things have been failing and how I can better use resources to fix issues like this in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I'm even more confused because if I run M-x package-list I can see the package there

My goal: 

Use Orgmode to customise my emacs and init files while using the Dropbox directory. I would also like to use a custom named init file so it's like eckoinit.el instead of init.el (For easier recognition and modification).

Overall, I'd like to sync and use emacs from different computers using the same configs.

I know one of my current snags is I can't remember how to tell emacs from Orgmode to use a differently named init file. I feel like this should be an obvious answer that I should have found by now and I feel silly.

I remember seeing an article that talked about the superfluity of parenthesis in Lisp code, and how non-Lisp programmers were overwhelmed by them, but Lisp programmers had trained their eyes to look at indentation structure and didn't see the parenthesis, and it showed an image of Lisp code without and with the parenthesis faded. I don't have a link to the article, but even as a slightly seasoned Lisper I thought the fainter parenthesis improved readability. 

So I'm wondering if/how it's possible to achieve this effect in emacs. Is there already a minor-mode for it? Would it involve a font-lock/face for parenthesis?

[Emacs-mac](https://bitbucket.org/mituharu/emacs-mac) is a beautiful port, and was the first to offer pixel-precise smooth scrolling nearly a decade ago.  But with modern high-resolution trackpads and high density displays, I found its scrolling handlers just couldn't keep up.  On large, full-screen buffers in a heavy mode, trackpad scrolling verged on painful, and, maddeningly, was much worse in one direction than the other.  And no wonder: modern trackpads deliver scroll events &gt;50⨉ per second!  The other key problem with all known smooth scrolling packages is they tend to stutter and loop back as you try to scroll across images taller than the window.

This package solves both of these problems:

* Scrolling performance has been increased 25-50⨉ — you move your fingers, the page responds, instantly.
* Large image handling has been worked around so you can scroll right across them without any hiccups.
* As a bonus, dumb mice get pretty good smooth(-ish) scrolling too.

I'll be contributing the core scrolling functions upstream, so hopefully `pixel-precision-scroll-mode` (which inspired this package, and is recommended on other builds) can make use of some of these improvements in the future.

Finally, this was all (to me) *surprisingly hard to achieve*, which you can [read all about](https://github.com/jdtsmith/ultra-scroll-mac#why-are-there-so-many-smooth-scrolling-modes--why-is-this-so-hard-its-just-scrolling) if you are a glutton.",t3

as nvim-user I am just starting out with orgmode and want to use emacs on 4 systems: 2 linux-boxes and 2 android-systems.

The linux-boxes run emacs 29, on android (in a termux/proot environment) the emacs version currently is 27.

I am using emacs only for orgmode with evil-mode and the modus-themes.

What I want is to have the same environment on all machines and so this is my plan:

I will use syncthing to sync all my org-files as well as the init.el between all machines and in the init.el I will only load packages with use-package.

So the idea is that when I e.g. introduce a new package on one machine, the new config is synced to the other machines and when I start emacs there the package is installed automatically - everything stays in sync.

Firstly; please forgive the gratuitous image of my RGB Steamdeck / Corne / DOOM Emacs ""coffee shop"" setup - I'm just enjoying it at the mo, and have a burning desire to share.

After a quick play with Zone I'm trying to setup `zone-matrix` as my ""screensaver""

I did the following:

1. Pulled the files from `zone-matrix` githib to `.emacs.d/zone/`
2. Added the following to my in my `config.el`. I realised I was comitting heresy for copying another person's config (from a stackexchange answer) and braced myself for errors; 

```
(defun tabbar-mode () (lambda (x) (message ""%s"")))
(add-to-list 'load-path (concat dotfiles-dir ""zone""))
(require 'zone-matrix)
(require 'zone-matrix-settings)
(require 'zone-settings)

(setq zone-programs [zone-matrix])
(zone-when-idle 60)

After a `doom sync` I get an (to be honest expected) error `void-variable` dotfiles-dir.

The issue I have is with the definition `dotfiles-dir` - I clearly don't have that variable set, and wonder which of the following is the least-worst approach:

1. Because I'm on DooM there is probably already a similar variable set linking to `.config/doom/` am I better putting the zone directory in there? If so, do I hard-code the path in the line containing `dotfiles-dir`?

2. Should I define a `dotfiles-dir` or `zone-matrix-dir` instead? I assume that flies in the face of dotfile conventions?

And last weekend I wrote a Confluence reader. After being BEYOND ANNOYED that you can't read pages without JS.I remember the old (and good) versions of Confluence that didn't force the fancy editor down your throat and you could write everything in wiki markup...anyway.  
The reader detects when a link isn't external, so it doesn't send you to EWW. It doesn't work in 100% of the cases, will probably revisit that code.

Previously I would copy the message-id of the email with emacs, then use a VBA function in outlook to find and open the same email in outlook, which works fine, but it's a bit slow and convoluted.    
Then I found out recently instead of doing that, I could just copy the maildir file as an .eml file and use outlook to open it(here it is necessary to change the line ending to CRLF).

For example, when I write in vue, I want to autocomplete a `watch` function. This function is available in the following packages

    import { watch } from 'vue';
    import { watch } from 'fs';
    import { watch } from 'fs/promises'
    ... etc

But when I use autocomplete in eglot I only see the first candidate - importing from the fs package. Is there any possibility or workaround to display all possible candidates?

Example of autocomplete with eglot

But, rather than do that, is there any other option for setting variables automatically for modes besides a hook like this?

Also, as a bonus question, if I wanted to also do something like enable show-paren-mode for all prog-mode buffers, which of the following do you consider ""better"" (assume that this is not something that is likely to change frequently):

**So I know if emacs is lagging I should run the profiler for a bit while it's lagging and then review the report. However, I'm not sure what to do next.** 

It looks clear that company / completion is responsible for the laggy behavior here, especially a jsonrpc-request made by completion. That makes sense, there's a slow network call somewhere in the works that's gumming things up.

I'm using eglot for lsp and would expect that would be the source of a slow jsonrpc call, maybe eglot trying to get completion candidates on every keystroke through the LSP server? But I don't understand the stack here well enough to know how to proceed in debugging or fixing things.

Would love any help. Knowing what to fix is great - but also I'm really interested in knowing how to know what to do next in general in this scenario.

The issue is now, I'd like to move the install or the built files to my host machine and run it, but it won't run. If I just try to move the $home/.local/opt/emacs folder to my own computer, and run it I get the following:

`./emacs-29.1.90: error while loading shared libraries: libgpm.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`

When I try to move the whole directory (source code and the build directories inside there) out of the virtual machine into the Host and try to run make install (this is after make and compilation completed) it says 

    make install
    if [ -x ./config.status ]; then	\
         ./config.status --recheck;	\
    else				\

I have tried to chown -R &lt;myusername&gt;:&lt;mygroup&gt; ./ to the whole directory but it still gives me the permission denied.

Any ideas how I might accomplish this task?

1848h8w,7,0.82,5,7,1862,248,2023-11-26T11:09:56Z,"Hello fellow Emacs enthusiasts,

I'm reaching out to see if there's anyone here who's successfully integrated a modern development environment within Emacs for Python programming. Specifically, I'm interested in a setup that incorporates eglot, tree-sitter and company.

I've encountered a significant issue: [whenever I enable python-ts-mode](https://github.com/hnarayanan/dotemacs/blob/main/.emacs.d/init.el#L100), Emacs consumes all my system's memory and crashes. While I've managed to use a more basic setup that [limits tree-sitter to syntax highlighting](https://github.com/hnarayanan/dotemacs/blob/fix-treesitter/.emacs.d/init.el#L122) only, I can't shake the feeling that I'm missing out on some great functionality.

To help with investigation:

* I am running on a Mac
* The bare minimum to reproduce this problem is on the following gist: [https://gist.github.com/hnarayanan/a6397d6723fce19e2802d4305071e611](https://gist.github.com/hnarayanan/a6397d6723fce19e2802d4305071e611)
* I happen to use Emacs from MacPorts, but to double-check, I also attempted to download it from [https://emacsformacosx.com](https://emacsformacosx.com) and it crashed in the same way
* This seems to happen independent of the language server used in the backend. I intend on using python-lsp-server, but it fails even if I don't have it installed.

Has anyone faced a similar problem and found a solution? Perhaps I am doing something very wrong with my config? I'm eager to learn from your experiences and would greatly appreciate any advice or tips you can offer.

Thank you!

**⚠️Edit⚠️**

This appears to be something inherently broken with tree-sitter as installed by MacPorts (or the particular language grammar for Python). I decided to dig into this and built both tree-sitter and Emacs from scratch, and they work really well together without my memory problems.",t3

What bothers me is the lack of ""on-line"" documentation (i.e. usable with eldoc or completion frameworks).

All calc functions are nicely documented here: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/calc.html ,  thats good.

It is possible to modify a elisp's function documentation. e.g. like so:

    (put 'calcFunc-vlen 'function-documentation
         ""Computes the length of a vector.
    The length of a non-vector is considered to be zero.
    Note that matrices are just vectors of vectors for the purposes of this command."")

Now `calcFunc-vlen` would have a nice ""on-line"" documentation, usable with `C-h f`, autocompletion and eldoc.

Has anyone already bothered to gather some of those strings from the manual,  in a more machine processable form? So I could save some work to create ""on-line"" documentation of the calc functions?

## Option 1: Open Vertico, Consult, and Embark candidate in a new tab (embark-dwim)
For users of Vertico/Consult/Embark, the following function utilizes the generic function `tab-new-func-buffer-from-other-window` to open the default Embark action buffer in a new tab:
```
(defun tab-new-embark-dwim ()
  ""Open embark-dwim in a new tab.""
  (interactive)
  (tab-new-func-buffer-from-other-window #'embark-dwim))
```

You can add the following key mapping to Vertico:
```
(keymap-set vertico-map ""C-t"" #'tab-new-embark-dwim)
```

For Emacs Evil users, you can also add the following mappings:
```
(evil-define-key '(insert normal) vertico-map (kbd ""C-t"") 'tab-new-embark-dwim)
```

## Option 2: Open Ivy, Counsel candidates in a new tab (ivy-call)
For users of Counsel/Ivy, the following function utilizes the generic function `tab-new-func-buffer-from-other-window` to open the buffer opened by `ivy-call` in a new tab:
```
(defun tab-new-ivy-call ()
  ""Open ivy-call in a new tab.""
  (interactive)
  (tab-new-func-buffer-from-other-window #'ivy-call))
```

You can add the following key mapping to ivy-minibuffer-map:
```
(keymap-set ivy-minibuffer-map ""C-t"" #'tab-new-ivy-call)
```

For Emacs Evil users, you can also add the following mappings:
```
(evil-define-key '(insert normal) ivy-minibuffer-map (kbd ""C-t"") 'tab-new-ivy-call)
```

I need to do the following in a quick way:

1- Encrypt a whole folder, and acces it. This folder will keep other folders with pictures and text files.

2- Set a number of columns for the page, like 80 or 100.

3- Have a tree-like explorer on the left, to navigate the files with the entries.

4- Do bold, italics, and different colors.

5- Make an index or a different way to navigate the entries, besides the tree explorer.

6- Export everything in case I want to change the program I use to read my entries.

7- Inserting an image from a folder, like a picture I took. It can be a miniature to click and open the original picture.

Can Emacs do that?

A visualisation can be rendered as follows:

```org
#+begin_src python :results output file :file usage.png
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import sys

df = pd.read_json(""data.njson"", lines=True)
axes = sns.histplot(df, x=""editor"")
axes.get_figure().savefig(sys.stdout.buffer)
#+end_src
```

The main trick here is to set the `:results output file` header argument to write the output to a file, and to save the figure to `sys.stdout.buffer` from Python.

- there's a variable (evil-move-cursor-back) you can change to make evil exit insert mode without moving the cursor one space left

**tl;dr** why do my org links not have a space before them (e.g. `check out thisLINK`)? I feel I'm missing something very basic here.

I was using org-roam today in doom emacs and forgot how irritating adding a new node is while writing. 

It nestles nicely up to the text before it - with no space in between. After posting on r/orgroam a kind soul told me this might be a wider issue - at least related to org itself, and maybe doom.

Does anyone know how to get a leading space before the node name / link? For example; my nodes come out looking like:

`something interesting is in thisNODENAME/LINK check it out`

For the love of RMS I want a space between *this* and *NODENAME*

I'm clearly being dumb, but can't figure this out. Surely enough people use emacs / doom emacs / org mode, and they are not all adding links everywhere with no leading space?

A suggestion on r/orgroam was put a double space before a link - is that it?",t3

What really got me into emacs was the interaction with the python repl. It was amazing. Only Jupyter notebooks did something similar for me. Lately I have been using VScode, as the notebook experience for data science is very good and emacs cannot really compete here as notebooks are web based since the beggining, and vscode is an electron app. Packages like ein was just an ok replacement. Also I have been using logseq instead of org-mode, as the android app is very good and allow me to add stuff from the camera and using the pen with the whiteboard. I am mainly using org-mode to define large project files and leaving logseq for note taking.  


The later but the hype with neovim and in much smaller scale with helix got me interest, as I have been using less emacs lately. So I decided to try them. And for the first time I feel I was in the presence of real competitors. Emacs has always been about text editing + poweful ide like tools added using plugins made by the community using a scripting language, in emacs case elisp. I liked VSCode despite the bloat because it was similar in spirit, a editor that can customize and make tools for using a scripting language, javascript. I never like vi/vim. Modal typing is nice for using command without modifier keys. But you could only use those commands on vi /vim, so I did not see the point in learning a typing system for some type saving. I always laugh with the emacs pinky meme, when in practice most vim users used screen and tmux and use ctrl all the time. And alt+tab for geeting to the browser. Plugins were not really enough for my coding and they were awful in comparison with the emacs ecosystem. And you can get evil mode in emacs. But neovim is a different beast. The change from the old vimscript to Lua and how the community embraced the change turn it into an editor very close to emacs. I installed the lazyvim distro, and my experience was very similar to doom emacs. Actually I found a bit better to update all the packages installed by default. And the interaction python was also closer to emacs thanks to iron.nvim. I could installed in a remote machine that I have issue installing a new version of emacs due to lack of permissions. So very nice experience.  


Helix is a monolitic editor that comes with ""battery include"", and it doesn't have a plugin system yet (although the devs might add a scheme like scripting in the future). But the editor is much more feature complete than neovim without plugins. It lacks a repl interaction, so I cannot really use but it looks nice and might have a interesting future.

My conclusion is that editors of all kinds are becoming more and more like emacs, a core with a plugin system. Emacs is a very tiny core and the rest is elisp so you can change everything, but most people never get close to try to do that. Neovim+Lua is a good example that a you don't need so much flexibilty and you don't even need a powerful scripting language. Lua point is to be simple enough without losing too much power. Vscode+JS is a similar story. We are witnessing carcinisation for editors.  ",t3

Here is a detailed tutorial to teach you how to install doom emacs for beginners.
And here have many common configurations for beginners too.

![img](https://github.com/sincebyte/neo-emacs/blob/master/image-use.png)  

Neo emacs has the following features:

* Code completion: Lsp-java supports maven and gradle project.
* Http client: Rest-client is a tool to manually explore and test HTTP REST webservices just like Postman.
* SQL client: Ejc-sql turns Emacs into a simple SQL client which supports various databases.
* Redis client: Eredis Non-blocking Redis client with focus on performance and robustness.
* Terminal emulator: Emacs-libvterm (vterm) is fully-fledged terminal emulator inside GNU Emacs based on libvterm.
* Knowledge management system: Org-roam borrows principles from the Zettelkasten method, providing a solution for non-hierarchical note-taking.
* [doomorgstyle](http://1.117.167.195/doc/doomorgstyle.html): An org html style template similar to doom doc.

Here I follow the rules, Try to keep the configuration of doom and enhance it. As a veteran, you may not use neo emacs directly. But the configuration here may also be useful to you!

I originally tried to do this using *just* capture templates (i.e., just an interpolated Lisp expression, no wrapper code), but I'm not sure that that's possible due to some flexibility problems with the Org-roam capture system.

One thing I'm not happy about is having to use my weird homespun `+save-current-buffer` macro, but the original `save-current-buffer` macro doesn't switch back for some reason.

I am kind of? happy about having gotten some experience with the `loop` macro. I'm still not sure I like it, but I understand better why it exists in a language that doesn't have other, more structure looping facilities.

17zl4uq,4,0.83,3,4,2495,382,2023-11-20T09:57:31Z,"Screenshot: https://0x0.st/Hwru.jpg

In this Screenshot you see the frames of two Emacs processes. The left frame has been
started by `emacs -q`, while the right frame has been started by `emacs -Q`. So no
personal configuration (besides `.Xresources`) is used. The version is Emacs 29.1.,
X11, Linux.

The left frame shows the font I'd like to use, and used since many years with Emacs
already. But the left frame also shows a ""distorted"" display of example characters.
The important character is `…`.  It is clearly visible in this screenshot, that Emacs
changes the font (glyph?) to display this character if the character needs to be
rendered in `bold`. (similar things happen to other characters or `itallic`)

Each frame has 3 windows. The top window shows an org buffer with various
characters. 

The second from top window is the output of `what-cursor-position`, of the normal
rendered character.

The bottom window shows the output of `what-cursor-position` with a `bold` character
where Emacs changed the font to display this character. (This lines are much wider
and taller, even though they contain the same number of monospaced letters.)


Emacs did not had this behavior of changing fonts to display certain characters in
versions v28.x and older (at least I never noticed it). I did not change OS installed
packages, fonts, setting and stuff, so I'm pretty sure it's an Emacs v28.x to v29.1
related change.

*What can I do to make Emacs behave like in older versions, i.e. not changing fonts to
display those characters?*

I tried various things (i.e. disabling HarfBuzz), but I am clueless what I need to
configure.

I know that the problematic setting is a `*font:` line in my `.Xresources` file.  But
finding a suitable font was some time consuming frustrating process, because I didn't
like other fonts for various (mostly readability or size) reasons.


TL;DR: Question: how can I make Emacs v29.1 to not change fonts to display certain
characters?

**Edit:** is there a possibility to have influence to Emacs fallback font choosing?
I'd like Emacs to choose (something like) this font:

     ftcrhb:-Misc-Fixed-normal-normal-normal-*-8-*-*-*-c-50-iso10646-1 (#x298)

instead of this (much to big) one:

     ftcrhb:-Misc-Fixed-medium-normal-normal-ja-13-*-*-*-c-120-iso10646-1 (#x3AD)

**Edit2:** `set-fontset-font` lets me change a fallback font. But `-Misc-Fixed-normal-...` fonts seem to have vanished from Emacs v29, while Emacs v28 on the same Linux system shows them?",t3

17zdgxw,5,0.7,10,5,4125,510,2023-11-20T02:01:09Z,"Hey, I was working on this one off and on for a few days after briefly trying out skeleton-mode, yasnippet, and some other stuff, and not really being too happy with them. I find that I have a lot of repetitive editing tasks where I need to do something to a small block of code a lot, but in the process change some names or values in a way that's just a little bit different each time. Normally this is where people would start to reach for yasnippet and auto-yasnippet, which is fine if that works for them, but personally that's just a bit more heavyweight and powerful than what I normally need. What I wanted was just a way to enhance a regular Emacs keyboard macro to support that sort of thing, so I wrote this. If it helps you too, wonderful!

To use, just press C-x Q (that's a capital Q, not a lowercase q) during keyboard macro recording, and press your normal enter/return/minibuffer-exit when you're done. I went through a lot of trouble figuring out how to make the minibuffer exit also exit the sub-macro recording!

    ;; Keyboard macro enhancement. If you call this, instead of
    ;; kbd-macro-query, it will prompt the user for a value. This value
    ;; will then be inserted into the buffer. Every time you call the
    ;; macro, you can provide a different value.
    ;;
    ;; Alternatively, you can call this with a prefix argument. If you do
    ;; this, you will be prompted for a symbol name. Instead of the value
    ;; being inserted into the buffer, it will be saved in the symbol
    ;; variable. You can then manipulate it or do whatever you want with
    ;; that symbol as part of the keyboard macro. Just, when you do this,

`helm-projectile-ag` is my current grepping tool but doesn't seem to offer such a facility, unless I haven't read the docs well enough.

My issues are:

1. It can present a lot of hits in the same file it but lists each one separately. A good option would be to fold the output when there are multiple matches, then I can use the Tab keep to expand the fold and scan through the previews and even edit them right away.

2. The search panel is modal. It doesn't create a result buffer which you can save and then return to later to continue to select files to edit. Once you lose focus it is gone. It doesn't even seem to retain the search term so you can use it later.

3. It would be nice to have a window that shows the actual CLI command passed to the search utility. I see them once in a while but it would be good to show them up front or make them easily accessible.

[v1.0.0 on GitHub](https://github.com/renzmann/treesit-auto/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

For those who don't know, `treesit-auto` enables automatic detection, installation, and usage of tree-sitter grammars and modes in Emacs 29+.  Vanilla Emacs exposes some variables and functions that facilitate this behavior, but without `treesit-auto` it's up to you to check when tree-sitter is available and configure how Emacs behaves when it is (or isn't).  This package takes that work away from you and is designed to fit what the vast majority of users would expect from automatic use of tree-sitter in Emacs.

This started out as just my own configuration to `treesit-language-source-alist`, `major-mode-remap-alist`, and `auto-mode-alist`, but now has a *lot* of features that didn't exist just under a year ago when I first announced it.

1. Automatic detection and installation for built-in tree-sitter modes, such as `rust-ts-mode`, `yaml-ts-mode`, `toml-ts-mode`, `typescript-ts-mode`, and `go-ts-mode`.  You can get this behavior through the `treesit-auto-add-to-auto-mode-alist` function (the name is too long...I know)
2. Less buggy behavior overall, such as ensuring we switch to the tree-sitter mode after installing it
3. Detecting and installing grammars required by the current mode, such as TypeScript and TSX requiring each other

This package isn't perfect.  It's honestly still a bit of a hack, and many parts of the code are too clever for my own liking.  It does its job, though, and I've been a happy, daily user of it for the last 9 months.  Of course, a big thank you to all who have supported the project and contributed to it along the way!",t3

17vxhw2,25,0.9,79,25,5374,826,2023-11-15T16:33:48Z,"Context:  

I've used Emacs off and on for many years at this point. Throughout that time there have been periods where I really leaned in to it and tried to use it for everything, and there have been periods where I only used it for org and/or magit, etc. I've learned lots of things about it and I've forgotten lots of things about it, but I've never been what I would call an ""expert"" or even a ""power user"". So, when I feel like something isn't working well in Emacs, I almost always default to the assumption that I'm doing something wrong or misunderstanding something, etc. 

So, it very well may be that I'm wrong/crazy in my recent conclusion that use-package might not be the ideal abstraction for managing Emacs packages.

With that out of the way, I'll say that when I first saw use-package, I thought it was amazing. But, in the years that I've been using use-package, I never feel like my init file is ""right"". Now, I'm starting to think that maybe it's use-package that's wrong and not me (insert Simpsons principal Skinner meme).

I don't know how best to articulate what I mean by use-package being a ""wrong abstraction"", but I'll try by listing some examples and thoughts.

## Autoloads

First of all, I feel like the way autoloads are handled with use-package is too mistake-prone. Libraries/packages typically define their own autoloads, but the use-package default is to eagerly load the package.

But, if we're using use-package to also manage installing the packages for us (`:ensure t`), then why shouldn't it know about the autoloads already and automagically imply a `:defer t` by default?

So, by default, we have to remember to either add `:defer t` or we have to remember that setting our own hooks, bindings, or commands will create autoloads for us.

I know that you can configure use-package to behave as though `:defer t` is set by default, but that's just broken for packages that don't have any autoloads.

It feels like maybe use-package is doing too many things. Maybe it was actually more correct in the old days to separate the installation, configuration, and actual loading of packages, rather than trying to do all three in one API.

## Configuration that depends on multiple packages is ugly/inconsistent

Many packages are fairly standalone, so you can just do,

    (use-package foo
        :defer t
        :config
        (setq foo-variable t))

and it's clean and beautiful. But, sometimes we have configuration that is across multiple packages. A real-world example for me is magit and project.el. Magit actually provides project.el integration, wherein it adds magit commands to the project-switch-commands and the project-prefix-map. That's great, but it will only run if/when the magit package is loaded.

So, my first guess at using use-package with magit was this,

    (use-package magit
        :ensure t
        :defer t
        :config
        (setq magit-display-buffer-function #'magit-display-buffer-same-window-except-diff-v1))

which seems reasonable since I know that magit defines its own autoloads. However, I was confused when I'd be using Emacs and the project.el switch choices showed a magit option *sometimes*.

I eventually realized what was going on and realized that the solution was to immediately load magit,

    (use-package magit
        :ensure t
        :config
        (setq magit-display-buffer-function #'magit-display-buffer-same-window-except-diff-v1))

but that kind of sucks because there's no reason to load magit before I actually want to use it for anything. So, what we can do instead is to implement the project.el integration *ourselves*. It's really just two commands:

    (define-key project-prefix-map ""m"" #'magit-project-status)
    (add-to-list 'project-switch-commands '(magit-project-status ""Magit"") t)

But, the question is: Where do we put these, and *when* should they be evaluated? I *think* that just referring to a function symbol doesn't trigger autoloading, so I believe these configurations should happen after project.el is loaded, and that it doesn't matter if magit is loaded or not yet.

Since, project.el is built-in to Emacs, it's probably most reasonable to do that config in the magit use-package form, but what if project.el were another third-party package that had its own use-package form? Would we add the config in the project use-package form, or in the magit use-package form? Or, we could do something clever/hacky,

    (use-package emacs
        :after project

But, if we do this a lot, then it feels like our init.el is getting just as disorganized as it was before use-package.

## Conclusion

This is too rambly already. I think the point is that I'm becoming less convinced that installing/updating packages, loading them, and configuring them at the same time is the right way to think about it. 

Obviously, if you know what you're doing, you can use use-package to great success. But, I think my contention is that I've been familiar with Emacs for a long time, I'm a professional software developer, and I **still** make mistakes when editing my init file. Either I'm a little dim or the tooling here is hard to use correctly.

I recently have become enamored of Typst for document creation.  It's fast, it's approachable, it's cross platform, and it's extremely capable even in preview beta.  I never really got the swing of LaTeX with all the backslash/curlybrace mayhem.  

In any event, I find myself actually working on a long technical document in Typst in Emacs.  There does exist typst-ts-mode so thanks tree-sitter and all those people who manage the grammar libraries for it.  However I'm finding myself in need of a better way of navigating the huge document to get to sections I want to do.

I looked into the baked-in bookmarks and I could probably use that capability, though I was hoping for more of an customizeable outline mode.  Manually setting the bookmarks for an entire document seems tedious.  I mainly just want to navigate by headings and that would be sufficient.

What do people use for this sort of thing (possibly in the LaTeX world?)  Just bookmarks with some sort of automated way of populating the bookmarks?  I did check the typst-ts-mode and while there are some functions there for compiling, there don't seem to be any functions for navigating by semantic structures.  Perhaps that's baked into tree-sitter itself?

Anyhow, any help greatly appreciated here.",t3

EMT leverages macOS's built-in NLP tokenizer by dynamic module to tokenize and handle CJK words in Emacs. It also introduces a minor mode (`emt-mode`) that remaps functions `forward-word`, `backward-word`, `mark-word`, `kill-word`, and `backward-kill-word` to their CJK compatible versions.

I work as a python developer, and I work on quite large code bases. The LSP experience is essential for me given the complexity, but I'm at the point of giving up, even though I've been an emacs user for the better part of a decade.

I use doom emacs, by the way, but I'm quite happy to try anything to solve this. I have considered to build an emacs config from scratch again to see if I can narrow down the experience, but right now I have not invested the time. But again, considering how frustrated and desparate I am, everything is on the table.


Let me describe what I need and what I've tried.

#### My requirements

I need my lsp to understand my environment in order to load in a custom `PYTHONPATH` variable. This I handle with a .envrc file and the emacs module `envrc`. This has worked without any problems so far.

For the actual LSP, I use `python-lsp-server` but I am not at all religious about it.

I run `mypy` on my codebase, and I'd like to use `ruff` for checking/formating, but I've used the other tools (`pycodestyle`/`black`) for now.

### lsp-mode

The lsp-mode is the one that is closest to being good, had it not been for the abysmal behavior over time. It seems that some memory leaking happens, and over time it becomes sluggish, sometimes blocking emacs for multiple seconds. 

### eglot

Eglot seems a lot faster, but has functional problems. I've often had to restart eglot when opening new python modules. 
I've tried to use eglot for months now, accepting the quirks to gain the speed, but the restart behavior is annoying, and I often get weird errors such as `error in process filter: Wrong type argument: plistp, []` repeatedly until I restart eglot again. No luck debugging that error so far either.

I'm also not super excited about the `.dir-locals.el` approach to customization, but should the other issues resolve, I'm willing to figure that one out.

### lsp-bridge
I was quite excited to hear about a third option that was super fast. However, I've not manage to get it to work with the `envrc` package, so I've parked that one.

So, I turn to you, kind strangers on the internet. Do you have a well-functioning python LSP setup in emacs? Have you experienced some of the issues that I have described and did you manage to solve it?

Do you perhaps have a described approach to building a great python setup with emacs? Please help me!",t3

Prior to upgrading to from 27.1 to 29.1, invocations

    (format-spec ""Hello %a!"" '((a . world)))

would evaluate to the string

    ""Hello world!""

As of 29.1, the behavior depends on whether a function is bound to `world`: If no function is bound to `world', the same result as in 27.1 will be obtained, but if a function is bound to `world', it will be invoked without arguments, and the return value will be used instead of the symbol name.

I.e., I want to use a monospace font for all strings of the form `\(...\)` or `\[...\]`, where `...` may include newline characters as well, as is common for equations written in math display mode.  


I'm an Emacs newb, so the best I could come up with was a regex-based font-lock:

    (progn
      (setq-local font-lock-keywords

      (font-lock-fontify-buffer))

And then running this on an org-mode-hook.

But this is definitely wrong. Not only does it remove all the nice org-mode styling applied to things like section headers, but it's also applying the fixed-pitch font to more than just the intended math fragments, suggesting issues with the regex at least.",t3

## Installation

Here's how to install Ultyas locally to `~/.local/bin/ultyas` using pip:
```
pip install --user ultyas
```

## Usage

You can convert Ultisnips snippets to the Yasnippet format by using the following command:
```
~/.local/bin/ultyas ~/.vim/UltiSnips/python.snippets -o ~/.emacs.d/snippets/python-mode/
```

Here are the available command line options for Ultyas:

One of the nice things that Forge did for me was showing the numbers of merge requests (in `!123` form) in my `magit-log` views. Some time ago, however, this stopped working. Actually, this stopped working quite some time ago, maybe a year or more. I was too lazy to report it and too busy to investigate. IIRC it didn't stop working right away for all repos, so I guess it is not related to e.g. upgrading to Emacs 28 (and it was definitely before I upgraded to Emacs 29.1). 

To investigate this in more detail, I created new clones of several projects, but that didn't change anything. I also tried a simplified Emacs config in a new home directory to make sure that Forge's database was created from scratch. Same problem persists. 

On Forge's Github pages, I found some references to interactions of Forge with `bug-reference-mode`, so maybe it somehow has to do with that? On the other hand, given that I used a fresh Emacs config + new clones, I guess this isn't the cause of the issue either.

the title already is quite specific, so I'll just try to explain a bit more.

I use `text-mode-hook` to activate `darkroom-mode` when I am in an org-mode buffer. This approach works quite alright, but I am struggling to make it work with another recent addition to my workflow, `desktop.el`.

I want to use `desktop` to save opened files, window and tab bar configurations. After some tinkering this also works out fine, however, when I use `desktop-read` on a constellation that contains org-mode buffers, it seems like darkroom-mode is applied twice, i.e. the font is even bigger than with normal `darkroom-mode` applied.

I have tried to use `desktop-after-read-hook` to re-initialize `darkroom-mode`:

&amp;#x200B;

    (defun or/re-initialize-darkroom ()
        (darkroom-mode -1)
        (darkroom-mode +1)))
    
    (add-to-list 'desktop-after-read-hook 'or/re-initialize-darkroom)

However, this does not seem to work, because the text still is oversized. If it were only for one tab or buffer where this is the case, I'd swallow that pill. However, it is the case in all org buffers, which is a tad too annoying with four tabs containing four different org files.

Thus, I'd love to hear about your experiences, maybe you've got a tip or two for me?

Have a good day!

**EDIT**: I have posted an issue [at Darkroom's Github page](https://github.com/joaotavora/darkroom/issues/16). In the meantime, I have found a solution that is workable. Copypasta from issue:

It involves filtering the buffer by whether they are derived from `text-mode` (my criterion for applying `darkroom`). If they do, I apply my fix from above to them. The function is then called by the `desktop-after-read-hook`.

```
(defun or/re-initialize-darkroom-programmatically ()
  (dolist (buffer (buffer-list (current-buffer)))
    (with-current-buffer buffer
      (when (or (derived-mode-p 'text-mode))
        (or/re-initialize-darkroom)))))

1. If I try to list my distrobox containers I get `invalid internal status, try resetting the pause process with` ... `podman system migrate`

2. If I try that command I get `Error: could not find a working conman binary` and then a list of (non home) paths.

if it is greated then 2 -&gt; add a hook to every new created window in the workspace and set the variable \`\`\` header-line-format \`\`\` to nil, thus it should be empty, but sadly i dont have time for that at the moment.

Of course it's still overlay-based, and some things are unchanged: e.g. how the text ""under"" it becomes devoid of certain elements like button decorations (when those are themselves created using overlays) and line numbers.

Doom has configuration set to modify the consult-buffer there to hide the currently active buffer which is at the top by default when I call consult-buffer.

But the use-case I have in mind require me to be able to make the images temporarily invisible, which I understand should be possible with overlays. Before going to images, I thought I'll try making it work with just plain text. But I cannot make it work. I'm able to create overlays, modify the text shown in the overlay, move the overlay, delete the overlay, but I'm not able to hide the content of the overlay by setting the `invisible` property.

I have looked at the manual, reading about overlays, overlay properties and text properties. I've tried to google for help but haven't managed to find anything. I have also tried to look at how existing packages(like the builtin `hideshow.el`) do this, but without success.

After doing the above 3 things I get the impression that what I'm doing should work, but still it doesn't work. My test case is to replace a bit of text on the first line of a file with an overlay. Then I want to make the overlay invisible. I'm using a file called `overlay-test.el` with the following code:

    ;; Comment
    (setq-default ov (make-overlay 4 11))
    (overlay-put ov 'display ""hej"")
    (overlay-put ov 'invisible t)
    (message ""properties: %S"" (overlay-properties ov))

When I run `M-x eval-buffer` on this, what I want to have happen is that the first line `;; Comment` is replaced by `;;`  . The empty space behind the `;;`  should be an overlay with the text `hej` and this overlay should be invisible. But this is not what happens. Instead of being invisible, the overlay with `hej` is visible. So the first line says `;; hej`.

The last line prints the properties of the overlay in the minibuffer and it says that the `invisible` property indeed is set to `t`. So I don't understand why the overlay still is visible.

I've also tried setting the variable `buffer-invisible-spec`, both via `setq` and the function `add-to-invisibility-spec` but without success.

When I test the above code, I open emacs with `emacs -Q overlay-test.el` and then do `M-x eval-buffer`.

If it matters, `emacs --version` outputs

    GNU Emacs 29.1.90
    Development version 18e2de1bec9c on emacs-29 branch; build date 2023-11-04.

and is compiled with quite a few optional features enabled. I also tried it with an old build of Emacs 30 with the same results.

It is my favorite terminal emulator of the bunch (yes even over vterm) and has actually improved my workflow. It does not need an external C library to be downloaded and in my opinion has the best keybindings of any terminal emulator I have tried. It has 3 main modes to cycle between:

1. Input Mode (C-c C-e) =  similar to vterm's copy mode the buffer 
becomes ""frozen"" for you to copy the text and scroll back and basically use all of emacs's nifty search features.
2. Char Mode (C-c M-d) = One of my favorite modes where basically every input you make short of the keys C-M-m or M-RET will be sent to the terminal. This means I can open vim/nano/emacs -nw all within the terminal buffer (which I do a lot as I ssh into machines regulary) and it works absolutely perfectly. 
3. Semi-Char Mode: The default mode where most inputs will be sent to the terminal. This mode does 90% of the job but if sometimes you have a weird mix of alt and control input combinations to send then the Char Mode is there for you.

Just wanted to bring more attention to this pacakage and would recommend others to try it a bit.

I have improved my roam functionalities in integrating some of the functions offered by u/daviwil in his great [video and post](https://systemcrafters.net/build-a-second-brain-in-emacs/5-org-roam-hacks/).

So listing the tags is not a problem, I also know how to limit the search of node using filetags.

But is there a possibility to create different categories of tags?

I an working in the customer support in the IT, and I would like to apply the same functionalities offered for TAGS to another kind of tags (named error\_tags).  
I already use the standard tags and filetags, but I need to link and search in my nodes (notes) for error\_tags, that are snippets of logfiles with error messages.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there any ""easy"" way to do it, or is the only way the creation of a property `#+error_tags` and the search using the package [org-ql](https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql) from u/alphapapa ?

17m8vwq,24,0.88,7,24,3590,409,2023-11-02T17:32:02Z,"I always envy the UI created by /u/Nicolas-Rougier but ever since it was Elegant Emacs and tried a few times, but did not successfully get the theme to look right on Windows. Last time I tried was June and it was a weird bookmark bug in Emacs 29.0.1. Today I tried again and finally make it look like in the screenshot. Without further ado, here is how:

First. you need to install Roboto Mono and Fira Code as required by NANO for looking as intended:

* Roboto Mono: [https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono)
* Robot Slab for writer-mode: [https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Slab](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Slab)
* Fira Code: [https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Code](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Code)

If you are using Emacs 29 or above, for some reason, NANO requires bookmark-menu-heading to be available; even (require 'bookmark) doesn't work. Here is a workaround:

      (defface bookmark-menu-heading
        `((((class color) (min-colors 89)) (:foreground ""#000000"")))
        ""workaround"")

See [this issue](https://github.com/rougier/nano-emacs/issues/147). After that fix, use straight (or you can manually clone and put NANO in your load path):

      (straight-use-package
       '(nano :type git :host github :repo ""rougier/nano-emacs""))

So far so good. Now, add the required modules:

      (require 'nano-layout)
      (require 'nano-colors)
      (require 'nano-faces)
      (require 'nano-modeline)
      (require 'nano-help)
    
      ;; writer-mode is basically org-mode that improves org-mode visual
      (require 'nano-writer)
      (add-to-list 'major-mode-remap-alist '(org-mode . writer-mode))
      (require 'nano-theme)
      (setq nano-font-size 18) ;; You need to set font size before loading NANO theme
      (nano-toggle-theme)
      ;; the bold face is set to medium, but on Windows 
      ;; it looks like regular weight, so just set the weight to bold
      ;; to properly show bold text in org-mode
      (set-face-attribute 'nano-face-strong nil :weight 'bold)

Here is my Emacs after setting all up:

* With Helm as a separate frame. I prefer helm in a frame to avoid the whole minibuffer expands and causes the entire area above it to raise up:

* Org-mode. To justify both side evenly, use \`enrich-mode\` and press \`M-j b\` on each paragraph.

As you can see, Helm looks much more minimal when using its own frame at a fixed location (its frame scaled with the width of the main frame) combined with a theme like NANO. There are extra steps to make Helm and Org looks like that, and I will create a separate guide if you like.

Even so, if you successfully setup the stock NANO theme, it's already looking good. Enjoy!",t3

I've just got Emacs 28.1 running on WSL2. I've been using Emacs on Windows for many years and I now want to switch to WSL for the speed benefit. However, I'd like to keep the ability to run my Windows installation of Emacs, using the same packages and configuration files as my WSL version.

The Home directory for my Windows Emacs installation is C:\\Dropbox\\Home, therefore I added the following lines to the init.el file loaded by the WSL Emacs installation:

    (setq user-init-file ""/mnt/c/Dropbox/Home/.emacs"")
    (setq user-emacs-directory ""/mnt/c/Dropbox/Home"")
    (add-to-list 'load-path ""/mnt/c/Dropbox/Home/.emacs.d"")
    (add-to-list 'load-path ""/mnt/c/Dropbox/Home/.emacs.d/elpa"")

The first line works, in that it does read the specified .emacs file. However, when it attempts to load some of the packages (specifically those found in C:\\Dropbox\\Home\\.emacs.d\\elpa) it fails, saying it cannot find the file or folder specified.

I can't figure out where it's looking for those packages and why it cannot find them despite me adding the package folders to the load-path var. Any help much appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

**LE. I finally figured it out.** Emacs was expecting me to recursively add all subdirectories of the packages dir to load-path. I used this snippet from the wiki and it now works fine:

    (let ((default-directory  ""/mnt/c/Dropbox/Home/.emacs.d/elpa""))
      (normal-top-level-add-subdirs-to-load-path))

I have removed all the .elc files since those are not cross compatible but it still didn’t work and I realise that it’s because the generated autoload file is specified to be using unix style line endings (LF) but when I cloned it in the windows machine, the autoload files will have dos style line endings (CRLF) therefore causing the issue.

Interestingly, the init file also uses CRLF and it still works presumably because it does not have the same specified coding as the generated autoload files.

How should I get around this problem? I’m thinking of setting core.autocrlf to false on my windows machine. While that works, I will have to remember to create new files in my .emacs.d with only LF to keep the git repo clean and also presumably for it to work. I also thought about regenerating those autoloads after a clone but I’m not sure how to do so. Hence, I’m looking to see whether others have better solutions to this problem.

    ** TODO Task c

Org folds blank lines at the end of any subtree into the latest subheading. So, when I start unfolding `Project 1`, `Task b` shows as `Task b...`, i.e. it seems to have some hidden description which is misleading. I always go to see what is under `Task b...` only to find its empty.

A compromise is to set `org-cycle-separator-lines` to `1`. However, this prevents the user from writing descriptions that are well spaced, as this will introduce unwanted blank lines in the folded view. For example:

    * Project 1
    ** TODO Task a
    
    - [ ] Subtask
    - [ ] Subtask
    
    ** TODO Task b

The above code shows as:

    * Project 1
    ** TODO Task a...
    
    ** TODO Task b

Hope your weekend is off to a great start. I'm starting my journey on Vim and possibly Emacs (although, who am I kidding, seeing some of its capabilities it seems an inevitability). One thing that would accelerate my timeline to jumping into learning Emacs is if it handled a particular use case that is crucial to me.

See, I do a lot of work in Jupyter Notebooks (Python) for school and ML/prototyping in general. One thing I like about notebooks is that if you make a mistake and the program fails, well, your intermediate calculations are still stored in memory and accessible. It's a graceful fail. If you fail through terminal, well, could be the end of what you calculated. 

The problem I have with Jupyter Notebooks is that they do not support parallel processing conveniently. I saw that Emacs has some interesting capabilities around notebook support; I believe org mode is what's used. 

I was interested in knowing if anyone uses Emacs as a way to get the best of both worlds: a way to run things using multiprocessing, but should things fail, it store the states in memory to rerun it.

Ainother day, another emacs doubt.

I'm using ivy-mode, and when I do `M-x` and write, the order of candidates for completion seems weird for me. I figure it obeys some logic, but I'd like to change it. For example:

I do `M-x` and write `coun bu`

Results are:

`counsel-switch-buffer` (this one is selected by default)

`counsel-ibuffer`

`counsel-buffer-or-recentf`

`counsel-minibuffer-history`

For me, `counsel-buffer-or-recent` should be the first candidate, since that's the one with shortest ""distance"" between a match for `coun` and a match for `bu`. Is there a way to make results be sorted by this? So that those 4 candidate should appear like:

`counsel-buffer-or-recentf`

`counsel-ibuffer`

`counsel-minibuffer-history`

`counsel-switch-buffer`

Another example. I make `M-x package-install` then write `consu`. There are almost 15 results before `consult`. Being the shortest one matching perfectly the string, IMHO this should be the first candidate.

Another example, `M-x dire`. Results:

`A couple of logical results` (because they start with `dired-`)

`tramp-crypt-add-directory`

`dired-jump-other-window`

How is it that `dired-jump` appears *after* `tramp-crypt-add-directory` if the match for `dire` is further in the `tramp-...` candidate?

Any hint on this?

I did end up making some progress. I deleted my configuration, reinstalled emacs, and then followed the instructions again.

But, now when I attempt to use dired to open a windows shortcut I get the error ""Wrong type argument: stringp, t"" in the mini-buffer.

I'm a fan of Emacs, like you folks.

I use Emacs org every day, mainly for my teaching class. Furthermore, I learn Emacs for three years ago.

But I struggle to achieve my learning of Elisp. For example, taping lisp and elisp code with evil/lispy is a true nightmare (I use Prelude with few modes, btw), not to mention when I type code block within org.

I knew the learning curve is hard. But I didn't expect that much frustration to learn it. The documentation is austere. So few examples are given. There is too little blogs or books about Emacs, specifically about org and babel.

To illustrate my point, let's take the `*this*` variable in babel, that I found TODAY by CHANCE in this page : [https://orgmode.org/manual/Results-of-Evaluation.html](https://orgmode.org/manual/Results-of-Evaluation.html).

It's a game changer for a lot of my code, and would deserve a whole page to illustrate it. But no, it's given in a «niche» example.

Don't be mistaken, I found Babel/Org/Emacs wonderful, but what a pain in the ass to learn it !

For such an old and wise piece of software, I can't understand why we don't have a smooth learning experience with Emacs. A lot of people could benefit Org/Emacs, without the big hinder of the «lack» of documentation (mostly examples).

Am I the only one to experience this ?

Edit : `*this*` is not a ""kind of macro"" but simply a variable. Thanks u/oantolin.

17g6npv,3,0.67,21,3,4922,318,2023-10-25T14:55:14Z,"I built Emacs 29.1 from source a few months ago and it was working pretty smoothly as far as I could tell -- I was mainly using the `elfeed-webkit` package -- until I tried to use it today and my Emacs session crashed. I was mainly using it in `daemon` mode, but even just running `emacs -Q` and then `M-x xwidget-webkit-browse-url RET wikipedia.org` results in the error at the end of this post (sorry for the wall of text).

From [the EmacsWiki](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsXWidgets) and from reading /etc/PROBLEMS, I tried to use `xwidgets-webkit` again with `SNAP=1 SNAP_NAME=1 SNAP_REVISION=1 emacs -Q`, but it results in the same error.

It's probably an issue with my system rather than Emacs -- I'm running this on Manjaro Linux, and `emacs-version` gives:

    GNU Emacs 29.1 (build 2, x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.24.38, cairo version 1.17.8) of 2023-08-28

What can I do to fix this?

**EDIT:** Here's a longer backtrace on the errors: https://pastebin.com/u9giC8Vq . I've also checked   Emacs 28.2 on my system, which I built with `xwidget` support -- this also crashes when using `xwidget-webkit-browse-url`.

17g6n6e,7,0.89,7,7,1444,187,2023-10-25T14:54:32Z,"[Thanks to Andrea](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2023-10/msg00590.html) (the original author of gccmacs), we can now ""redump"" Emacs even with some natively compiled elisp in the mix.  I've been cautious in my experiments so far, but: this works on Windows!

From a MSYS2/MINGW64 bash shell:

`$ bin/emacs --batch -Q -eval '(let ((custom-theme-load-path (list ""&lt;path&gt;/.emacs.d/elpa/cyberpunk-2019-theme-20191008.1133/""))) (require '""'""'erc) (load-theme '""'""'cyberpunk-2019 t) (enable-theme '""'""'cyberpunk-2019) (dump-emacs-portable ""erc.pdmp""))'`

`$ bin/runemacs.exe --dump-file erc.pdmp -fs -l &lt;my-erc-setup&gt;`

This seems to get a ""fullboth"" frame with my theme pretty fast.  Note, I can't trigger connection quite yet at that point; the `runemacs` call is loading my full init, and some parts that take a further moment.

Also, the first command, which created the custom portable dump called ""erc.pdump"" loaded by the second command, was nearly instant.  Here's a look at what this did to size of the the pdmp file.

That is effective.

Emacs has been my faithful companion for over 5 years, and I just stumbled upon this remarkable feature minutes ago.

Typically, I rely on async-shell-commands to open the current buffer directory in Windows 10's File Manager, then move files from folder to folder.

But, now, this seeming-trival discovery has  greatly enhanced my workflow, instill in me a strong sence that Emacs not only coexists within the operating system, but rather embodies the operating system itself.

While it is true that Windows does not support dragging files from dired buffer to external locations, but I seldom encounter such a requirement in my day-to-day workflows.

Have you ever had such an experience that discovered an amazing  feature after a long time using Emacs？what is it?

17ewu0j,14,0.94,16,14,1677,253,2023-10-23T22:17:38Z,"I love git worktrees. It took me a while to change my workflow and get used to doing things differently, but it is so much better. I never have to think ""oh my repo is in inconsistent state, I can't switch my focus and start reviewing this PR, I need to first stash/commit/stage/etc. my stuff...""

I also love how Magit lets me create a worktree from a PR or an Issue (some of that is built-in, some I extended to fit my workflow). One thing is still missing though.

Cloning or starting a new repo in a practical way to be used with worktrees, for me, always requires some manual process.

First, I need to follow the recommendation I borrowed from [this blogpost: How to use git worktree and in a clean way](https://morgan.cugerone.com/blog/how-to-use-git-worktree-and-in-a-clean-way/). It boils down to:

    mkdir my-awesome-project
    $ cd my-awesome-project
    $ git clone --bare git@github.com:myname:my-awesome-project.git .bare
    $ echo ""gitdir: ./.bare"" &gt; .git

But when I do that, git doesn't see remote branches anymore. So some stuff won't work as normally expected. For that, I have to follow this [advice from SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17714159/how-do-i-undo-a-single-branch-clone/17714718#17714718), basically adding to ./bare/config:

    [remote ""origin""]
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
        
And now I'm thinking, before I try to automate this. Maybe Magit already does the right thing and I just never knew about it? Or maybe it's much simpler than that and all that manual hocus-pocus is not needed?

How do you use worktrees with Magit? And if you don't use worktreees, why is that? Is there even a better way?",t3

I want to create a similar one: I want to create an event in a select customer file and to create this customer file if it does not exist.

The filter of the nodes with the tags ""customer"" works, but I am stuck with the definition of the content to insert as the event:

\- I want the events to be inserted as subheadings of the heading ""History"" of the customer file (easy)

\- I want the events to be saved as a tree structure:

    ** Year
    *** Month
    **** day
    ***** Event 1
    ***** Event 2....

I am trying to modify his code, but I always have errors

\- I have replaced `plain` with `entry` in order to get the content as a heading

\- I have replaced `file+head+olp` in the template definition by `file+olp+datetree`

It's in a bare-bones state, but I've been finding it very useful for almost a year now.  I keep wanting to fix/enhance a few more things before I publicise, but ... I think others could find it as useful as I do already.  It's not yet published on ELPA etc., but I intend to soon.

The stand out features are:

 * Multiple simultaneous journalctl processes may run simultaneously with the
   output interleaved.  E.g.:
   *  simultaneously view a broad query, say at '--priority warning' along with
      a more narrowly focused '--priority debug' query.
   *  Dig into the output within or near a region by requesting additional log
      records.  To facilitate this, if the region is active when you add an
      additional command, the kill ring is augmented with a
      `--since=... --until=...` string generated from the region's timestamps.
 * The complete JSON log record is processed facilitating richer features
 * The full JSON record for a given log line under point may be summoned and
   examined
 * Where the record includes file name and line number, you can jump from a
   message record line to the generating source file/line

Further details and key bindings are included in the Commentary section of [journalctl-mode.el](https://github.com/WJCFerguson/journalctl-mode/blob/master/journalctl-mode.el) and docstrings of the entry functions.

Its usage is somewhat rudimentary, with minimal UI and no cool command-construction GUI like magit or anything, though with `bash-completion` set up that's not a big hardship.  It also currently is not flexible in output format, but that may come!

If you habitually monitor journald please let me know what you think and give it a try, and let me know what you think should be fixed or enhanced most urgently in the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/WJCFerguson/journalctl-mode/issues).

There exists another [`journalctl-mode` package](https://github.com/SebastianMeisel/journalctl-mode/commits/master) that looks nearly abandoned and more quick-and-dirty, but does look to be aimed at other usage patterns.  So I'm creating a naming clash here and *possibly* a downgrade for some use-cases(?) - let me know what you think about that in the comments.",t3

As everyone on this community, I'm an Emacs power user and have several niceties configured, gnus for Email, Doom Emacs, and I heavily use org mode, I recently used it for a 'Incident Playbook' which was basically making an incident and responding to it following certain steps, more of a Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) work. 

So, I made a server in Ansible, made a test malware that will be ran in this server (delete a log file idk), and proceeded to do everything directly in org-mode, running every command via tramp to the server, getting any info from the disk and getting a dd and such. Finally I made a whole document with full details on the server in that point in time, which was pretty interesting as I could have this as a template for future incidents and have certain commands saved for this.

And I got the idea, wouldn't it be interesting to have org mode files like these but for testing specific vulnerabilities?, even using a tool like NixOS or Guix to make commands that will get the old version x.x.x of nginx and I could test a vulnerability there, so it is also reproducible and everyone can use the org file and test this vulnerability?, basically more of a study and proof of concept rather than something more 'heavy' as in business related.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have a similar use case?, I would love to hear for them as I want to go into the DFIR route.

I use orgmode links extensively. In particular, I have hundreds (our thousands) of links to emails (in notmuch). I would very much like to add a tag to any email that is being referenced from org.

So, what I need to do first is be able to find all matches of a regular expression in all my org files. Non-interactively.

I have been playing around with `xref-matches-in-directory` but that would not cover when multiple emails are mentioned in the same line...

I have been looking and looking but everything I find missed the non-interactive part. 

So: What is the function to ""search for this REGEX in FILES in DIR and return the first capture group""? (the regex has a capture group for the msgid)

The regex:
```
  (rx-to-string
   (rx ""notmuch:id:""

I am working in IT support, and ```occur``` (and even more ```multi-occur-in-matching-buffer```) ist my tool of choice.

But I would like it to do more (because why not?)
I would like to be able to ignore matches, if terms (let's name them excludees) are found in the next 5 lines from the search string match or within a number of lines defined by a variable.

It would allow to save excludees as a list, and ignore certain matches when for instance the ""ERROR"" relates to a known bug, and we do not want to see it in occur searches any longer.

Ideally, this could be triggered by a keymap in occur-mode-map, (toggle-ignore-excludees), so that it is up to the user to activate it or not.

is there already a similar function that does it?
How would you proceed to achieve this?

17bp0vn,8,0.79,2,8,2726,453,2023-10-19T17:48:52Z,"Ever since DistroTube finished his Configuring Emacs series a couple of months ago, I moved from using (the somewhat monolithic and impenetrable in my opinion) Doom Emacs every now and then, to seriously using Emacs with his config about a month ago, and I've fallen in love. So much so that I clearly wanted to start using Emacs as my window manager.

I really like having a statusbar, so since I had been using dwm (also, if you want dwm-like window management, Edwina is the package for you), I figured it was finally time to set Polybar up. I did, but as many people experienced, Polybar had the issue of workspaces being off by one with the standard EMWH module. I looked around, and wasn't able to find the solution anywhere else, so I'll post my solution.

The crux of the problem lies in an assumption made in the code for switching workspaces, provided by the EXWM developers, namely the following code: [I'm not even going to begin to fight Reddit's markdown on this one](https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm/wiki#global-key-bindings). The workspaces created are zero-indexed, which is all well and good for Polybar, but the bindings are where the problems come up. The code assigns workspace 0 to s-0, workspace 1 to s-1, etc. (and I don't claim to be any kind of Elisp guru, since as mentioned, I've only been seriously using Emacs for about a month or so). The problem is that the EWMH plugin counts workspace 0 as 1, workspace 1 as 2, etc., and also because of the way the bindings work, you end up with 10 total workspaces at the end.

The (mostly satisfying) solution I found is to change the last two lines of the mapping.... whatever you wanna call it. This maps workspace 0 to s-1, workspace 1 to s-2, etc. Naturally, this requires configuring exwm-workspace-number.
`                          (exwm-workspace-switch-create ,(- i 1)))))`

`                    (number-sequence 1 exwm-workspace-number))`

There is a resulting issue with this solution though: the ninth workspace. The mapping thingamabob gets a bit upset if 10 gets passed into it, so you need to map s-9 manually, but that's easy enough to do with a short helper function. Something like
`  (defun exwm-workspace-switch-to-9 () (interactive) (exwm-workspace-switch-create 8))`
and then bind as you would any other global key. This allows the EWMH module to work just fine, without any need for any hooks or anything like that. Outside of having to define another function, this is about the most satisfying solution I've been able to come up with. Naturally, if anyone has any even-more-elegant solution, I'd love to hear it, but I'm plenty happy with this. This way, polybar is able to show what workspaces EXWM buffers are open on, alerts, etc.",t3

17bly51,13,0.84,14,13,3472,493,2023-10-19T15:32:46Z,"I have been experimenting with PlantUML in Org Babel recently, and it has greatly enhanced my ability to visualize concepts mentally. During post-meal walks, I often engage in mental planning exercises, such as sketching Gantt charts. However, my deficient drawing abilities consistently impede my progress, particularly when it comes to mentally manipulating lines, arrows, and objects. Since discovering PlantUML, the visualization skills have steadily improved, thanks to its intuitive text-to-graph syntax.

When reading ""Marcovaldo: Or, The Seasons in the City"" before bedtime for sleep aid, I spend a significant amount of time immersed in its pleasing pages, sometimes without a clear sense of progress. In such instances, I draw a Gantt chart to gain a visual representation of the slow progress.

This chart illustrates that the book is being read slowly, and at the current pace, it will take another three weeks to complete.

PlantUML's Gantt chart is expressive, it  mimic  task bars as  \[ \] , specify durations with the ""lasts"" keyword, and ""complete"" to indicate progress with percentages. This helps to  construct mental diagrams and translate thoughts or words into visual representations effortlessly, eliminating the need for manual drawing of lines, arrows, and objects. This feature is particularly beneficial for individuals with limited drawing skills.

PlantUML's Gantt chart functionality goes beyond planning in days, months, and other timeframes. It can also be adapted to manage a single day effectively. Although the smallest unit in PlantUML is a day, it can be flexibly adjusted to represent hours within a day. This means that a Gantt chart spanning 24 days can be used to represent 24 hours each.

Also, I had autogroup that breaks undo every 4 seconds.

Basically, this configuration breaks undo on almost every possible type command, every Spacebar, Enter, comma, bracket, moving up, down, everything. This is because I hate when undo deletes the whole screen of text.

How do I replicate this in Emacs? I read [this](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Undo.html), but it doesn't say what is considered a ""recent change"".

**SOLVED**. First of all, I would like to thank /u/orzechod, /u/Gandalf_the_Gray, /u/7890yuiop, /u/bravosierrasierra and /u/db48x.

Emacs groups ""recent edits"" in variable `amalgamating-undo-limit` that defines how long is this ""recent edit"".

So I put this in `.config/doom/config.el` and it works:

     (setq amalgamating-undo-limit 0)

Also, as /u/7890yuiop mentions, there is a mistake in documentation. It recommends to set `amalgamating-undo-limit` to `1` to turn off grouping edits, whereas it should be `0`. In case of `1` it would undo last two symbols, for example.

By the way, I've seen several configurations scattered around the web, and something tells me that I've ended up in another anarchic realm (which is, something I both hate and love), as if that of distros -being the same except for one thing- wasn't enough.

Of interest are: Python, Go, Bash, Clojure, Elixir, yaml (Docker, Terraform, Ansible), json, csv

17af6qf,24,0.96,12,24,1925,231,2023-10-18T01:56:18Z,"I am not skilled in drawing, but after trying PlantUML, I found that I  can create visual representations directly using code. This has greatly  aided my spatial imagination.

Take, for example, the usecases diagram:

    @startuml
    :user: -right-&gt; (Right)
    :user: -up-&gt; (Up)
    @enduml

https://preview.redd.it/1bx7h7sa7vub1.png?width=152&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6271256f6855b88a93a62abf63569f1bc542ded5

With the use of directional terms like ""up"" and ""right,"" you can intuitively draw the diagram as shown. it  lowers barrier for non-artists - no drawing ability needed and  focuses thought process on structural elements and relationships.

When immersed in text, our spatial imagination can often become less  active. For example, when trying to imagine the hierarchical structure  of an article such as org-mode, our mental representation tends to be more like a bullet  structure in an editor, rather than a graphical tree structure.

PlantUML addresses the challenge of limited spatial imagination by  providing an intuitive text-graph syntax. One notable feature is the  Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) functionality.

Consider the following example:

    @startwbs
    !theme mono
        * Emacs
        ** Texting Editing
        ** Note taking
        ** File Manager
        ** Literature Programming
    @endwbs

The WBS feature in PlantUML facilitates the effortless transformation of  a vertical structure into a horizontal representation. This allows me  to mentally interpret and visualize the PlantUML code, automatically  converting the vertical structure into a spatially-oriented horizontal  structure in mind. Consequently, it effectively resolves the issue of my limited  visual imagination and improving it continually.

* [Sacha's config](https://sachachua.com/dotemacs/index.html) using `set-window-configuration` and `current-window-configuration`  more than `display-buffer-alist.` The Ediff settings stick out to me
* [burly.el](https://github.com/alphapapa/burly.el) by u/alphapapa \- might be an easier way to approach the `current-window-configuration/set-window-configuration` that Sacha has implemented
* [Prot's window config](https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles/-/blob/master/emacs/.emacs.d/prot-lisp/prot-window.el) \- A lot of custom functions to help tailor the window management experience to his liking.

Long story short, I have two folders (not nested or anything):

* `folder1` - A git repository of a large julia project that I cloned.  Starting `eglot` here only works partially.  Anything imported from other packages is a missing reference.

* `folder2` - A folder I created with various scripts that I wrote for the project in `folder1`. It contains a `Project.toml` detailing the necessary julia environment for those scripts to work.  Starting `eglot` here works flawlessly.  Both functions defined in `folder1` as well as the other packages `folder1` relies upon are referenced correctly.

Is there a way for me to start `eglot` in `folder2` but have it work as if I have started it in `folder1`?

Alternatively, can I tell `eglot` in `folder1` to connect to the language server that was started by `eglot` in `folder2`?

However, its conceptual abstractions are intriguing. Take, for example, the following code snippet:

    (loop for i below 10 sum i)

The utilization of the term ""below"" in this context is particularly striking. Contrastingly, in languages like JavaScript, I typically read ""i &lt; 10"" as ""i less than 10,"" pronouncing the two words ""less than"" in order to read the ""&lt;"" symbol.

The act of reading ""&lt;"" as ""less than"" momentarily interrupts my cognitive flow between the two words. The loop macro condenses it as a single word, ""below,"" allowing me to pronounce ""i &lt; 10"" more succinctly and smoothly, without interruption. Another viable alternative could be ""under.""

Moreover, the expression \`1 &lt; i &lt; 10\` can be read as ""from 1 to 10.""

178em7u,29,0.98,46,29,846,136,2023-10-15T12:45:42Z,"Hello to all,  
I recently stumbled upon the setopt function introduced in emacs 29.

&gt; defmacro setopt (&amp;rest pairs)

&gt; Set VARIABLE/VALUE pairs, and return the final VALUE.
&gt; This is like 'setq', but is meant for user options instead of
&gt; plain variables.  This means that 'setopt' will execute any
&gt; 'custom-set' form associated with VARIABLE.

So basically it looks like a customize-set-variable but shorter. Indeed, both are defined almost next to each other, with most of the interesting bits duplicated.

After reading its source code, I have the impression that its only major difference with customize-set-variable (besides the fact that customize-set-variable is also a user command) is related to user theme.

I am not sure about the impact of using one over the user, do you guys have an opinion about this ?
Cheers",t3

Here's a problem. I need a tool that does basically this: I type a search phrase (name) and it shows every entry in an org file that contains this name, and if there's no entry with this name (i.e. heading with this name), automatically creates it.

So it's basically deft, but deft works on multiple files which I find extremely inconvenient. I read the docs, but found no way to configure it to work on a single file.

I believe it is possible to do with a simple org-capture using a custom function that checks if there is a heading in an org file and creates it if there is not. But elisp is high above my knowledge level right now and I don't want to invent the bicycle given how simple my problem is.

I am extremely overwhelmed with options, but I think there must be some simple way to do this that does not require writing some custom code and (preferably) installing more plugins than I already have.",t3

It seems that when I compile an org mode with emacs, the jobname is not the file name., so nothing gets embedded. If I include...

    \begingroup\escapechar=-1
    \xdef\jobname{\expandafter\string\csname main\endcsname}
    \endgroup
    \usepackage[main,include]{embedall}

then if the org file my tex file compiles to is named ""main,"" then the file embeds successfully. I'd like to make it so that ""main"" is the name of whatever file I am working on at the moment.

In my org configuration file, I currently have...

    #+begin_src latex
    \begingroup\escapechar=-1
    \xdef\jobname{\expandafter\string\csname main\endcsname}
    \endgroup
    \usepackage[main,include]{embedall}
    #+end_src

which is noweb'd into a variable that is used to load the snippet into my document.

Can I use the `:var` parameter to get the make this the name of the file being exported, just without the extension? If there is a better way to do this (like by using the -jobname parameter for the pdf process) I am open to using that too. Any help is appreciated. Thank you.

**UPDATE**

I found out that this was actually caused by the opening comment the exported tex file, which is...

specifically, it seems to be the `%&amp;`. I am not really sure what this does in latex. Is there any way to remove this? I wouldn't mind if the whole line was removed, honestly.

I recently tried installing kde-plasma-desktop with sddm on an Ubuntu 22.04 installation with GNOME. I didn't try it in a vm first and thought I could just get away with having both on my machine with no problems. Stupid, I know. I ended up removing KDE and reinstalling gdm, but now I'm missing all of my GTK icons when I start up Emacs.

https://i.imgur.com/fRdlr8o.png

The strange part is, that only *sometimes* the usual GTK icons will show up, and it's always when I least expect it. I suspect that some of the config changes that happened when I installed KDE conflicted with my GTK and my QT themes.

I've tried removing gtk3.0 and gtk4.0 folders from my ~/.config directory, removing ~/.local/share/icons, and inspecting ~/.themes, but I see nothing related to icons there. I'm just wondering what could be causing this behavior, and if it's conflicting with other applications on my system I haven't discovered yet. GNOME tweaks says I'm using Yaru-magenta-dark, which appears to be working everywhere except for Emacs.

Interested what people's thoughts are on this. I don't care much for the icons in the first place, but I thought this behavior was strange. Thank you",t3

I don't like this. Why does it work like that? What I want about these packages is to let me define what folder is a project, explicitely. I want to tell them, ""hey, this folder is a project"", even if its empty, and I never want them to automatically add any project.

I'm a web developer working a lot with typescript in the frontend and backend.

I started off with some basic packages like projectile, LSP, magit and evil. However I'm getting kind of annoyed using evil mode, because i have to consider stuff like deactivating certain keys wenn i'm in another buffer (e.g xref buffer) or undos that dont work out of the box properly.

Furthermore I would also like start learning more elisp, for which reason I'm doubting if i should even use vim bindings, because paredit seems to be a thing that i cant get working with vim bindings.

However I also dont want to leave my vim skills behind and would rather prefer a professional emacs config that is tailored around evil, if thats possible.

Can someone recommend a lightweight emacs config repository for ergonomic evil usage? Something thats really small and easy to understand and extend (So no spacemacs or doom).

Seeing [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/16hwjby/how_to_get_graphical_not_termuxbased_emacs_on/) post explain how to install and use Emacs on Android (native build), I wanted to share a tip on how to have a unified *init.el* file which can be synced across both Android and Linux so you don't have to change anything manually.

Here is an example for my org notes:

    ;; Setting the base directory for org files
    (setq org-directory
          (cond
           ((eq system-type 'gnu/linux) ""~/Notes"")
           ((eq system-type 'android) ""/storage/emulated/0/Notes"")
           (t ""~/Notes"")))

Essentially, for each part of the *init.el* file which is different based on the system it runs on, you can detect the appropriate system and do a different configuration.

This will resolve any of your Android specific changes you need to implement, like I have with my org notes location in the presented example.

With this, you can have the same *init.el* file and simply sync it across your systems.",t3

My story:

**Evil:** I came to Emacs after a long time of using Vim. Everyone told me to just use Evil and be done with it. I tried Devil but I dont know what it is about it that it left me dissatisfied. There was this feeling that I need to learn Emacs way of doing things. Because all documentation or tutorials I get have Emacs keys. Virtually none of them tell how to do same things in Evil. Always felt like an outsider. Jokes like `C-x M-c M-butterfly` made me feel like I am not in on the joke because I use Evil. I wanted to learn the Emacs way.

**Pure Emacs:** So I uninstalled Evil and went all in to pure Emacs keys. I learnt them quickly but key chords always felt difficult on my fingers. Then I found God mode and Devil mode. Great thing about both is that I don't have to define custom key-bindings or learn new key-bindings. They both work out of box and if I know Emacs bindings that's all I need to know.

**God mode:** First I used God mode for one month. Then I used Devil mode for one month. Both are similar but different. Similar that I don't have to learn new keys like Evil or Spacemacs. But difference is huge. God mode is modal. You are either in God mode or you are not. If you are in God mode you cannot insert text. Not a big problem when I am writing code. It feels like Vim if I am writing code. But it is a big problem when I am using ERC or Vterm or any sort of REPL. Like in Vterm if I change to God mode I cant insert commands. I have to disable God mode to type commands. The constant enabling and disabling of God mode in Vterm felt like burden.

That's why I never used `set -o vi` in Bash. Same problem with `set -o vi` ... you have to keep changing between insert and command mode to type command and edit commands. In full interactive prompts, modeless editing is best. So always `set -o emacs` for me in Bash. That is what drew me to emacs but that is a different story.

Another big problem with God mode is that it does not work in minibuffer. It works only very little in search mode. I think only `s` is supported in search mode. The other search mode commands don't work in God mode. I think this was my biggest problem with God mode. I mean a big nice thing about Emacs is that everything is a buffer and minibuffer is a buffer and all editing commands work in minibuffer. But God mode doesn't work in minibuffer. :(

**Devil mode:** Then I tried Devil mode for one month. I am liking it. It works fully in minibuffers and search mode. I am using it with its default `,` as devil key which is like the leader key in Devil mode. It doesn't disrupt my normal text editing. I can keep inserting text like usual but I can also run emacs commands by pressing `,mx`. Don't have to disable/enable it everytime. I can always leave it enabled. Devil is also clever that when I am writing lists like `[10, 20, 30]` it understands that I am writing normal text and it lets me write that without disrupting my flow. It multiplexes ""insert mode"" and ""command mode"" in a way that just works. I don't know how they did it but it just works. And some keys that I feared running before like `M-w` or `M-^` are so easy to do with Devil with `,mw` or `,m^`. Another one I like is `,m&lt;` or `,m&gt;` to go to the top and bottom. Navigation feels like Vim with things like `,nfpbnnnffbbb`. Its just `,bnpf` instead of `hjkl`.

So this is my journey of God, Devil and Evil and my review. Hope it was useful to some people. I think Devil might be it for me. Going to try it for another few months and report back if I find something new about it.

I also want to know from you about what chordless package you use and what you like or don't like about them?

P.S. The presence of all these modes make me happy that I did the right decision by switching to Emacs for life. So much choices. There is no way anyone will write packages like this which change the fundamental way to type keys in Vim. Is it even possible to change the basic way of handling key inputs in vim? But in Emacs, you can reimplement all key input handling from ground up to create a Vim within Emacs. Wow.",t3
1761zhc,3,0.71,7,3,3158,417,2023-10-12T08:31:10Z,"Hi all,

I recently did ""something"" in an `emacs` buffer and lost a bunch of text in different places, and I was unable to `undo` the deletions. I tried to use `ediff` (I guess I should have used `ediff-backup`?) to recover the lost text but not being competent I mixed up buffers ""A"" and ""B"" and ended up copying the deletions to the backup file and couldn't recover from there .... :-).

Now I am curious if there are recent 'best practices' to 

1. Avoid doing 'something' that causes text to disappear
2. Have a more robust, for a beginner like me, set of autosave and associated settings.

I found/checked the following sources:

[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html\_mono/ediff.html#Major-Entry-Points](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/ediff.html#Major-Entry-Points)

[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html\_node/elisp/Auto\_002dSaving.html](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Auto_002dSaving.html)

[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html\_node/emacs/Version-Control.html](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Version-Control.html)

However, regarding the manuals, I think I could benefit from some guidance on how to set up the most robust system (I rather have a lot of littering but with a robust ability to recover files vs a no-littering approach). And regarding users that experienced the same issue, the posts and replies are several years old so maybe obsolete with current emacs version (and package ecosystem).

I am looking for some recommendation to either disabling certain key bindings (e.g., linked to commands that can select/delete a lot of text), or perhaps change certain default settings (e.g., like the one for org-mode that prevents deleting text in folded sections). Or anything that works for you :-).

If the answer is outside of emacs, ie use git with some auto-commit script running in the background, I'd be interested in recommendations as well. I use emacs on my personal MacBook Air and on my company Windows laptop. I don't need to share my files with anyone, I just want to be able to recover from stupid user errors on my side :-).

(I backup to external drives as well, but my scenario is more 'OMG I pressed some key chord when I was doing something else and thought another application was focused but it wasn't. Worst part is I typically don't notice immediately, but only after a while, I may have even been adding a lot of text before realizing I somehow lost a whole bunch of other text somewhere else in a file - I think I read about a setting that asked for confirmation before a large amount of text is killed, but I couldn't find it back. And I also make such mistaken on smaller pieces of text, like a TODO heading in org-mode.)

As some of you probably did, i jumped on the treesitter train with emacs 29.1.

I replaced my major modes by their ts counterparts, and gave it a try. For the keywords colors, it was mostly fine, and at first I only checked that and was content with it. 

Things went a bit sour when I starting writing code, in particular the indent-rules.
I have used mainly the following so far :
- cmake-ts-mode
- c++-ts-mode
- yaml-ts-mode

Over the past two weeks there has not been a work day where I did not have to complete or ""fix"" indentation rules to my liking.

On the one hand it is much easier than before to tweak things, where either there was a customizable variable, either you were screwed. Now you can add rich rules, kind of easily

On the other hand, the out of the box experience was much worse, barely usable indentation especially for the c++ mode which, despites its 4 presets, lacks the many quick toggles from cc-mode. 

I do commend maintainers though for their amazing core implementation, the api + utilities make debugging tree sitter rules a breeze.

Does anyone know if there is a plugin for Emacs that offers like a popup where you search recent files.

So current work flow is compile switch to terminal run binary, switch back make changes compile return to terminal Ctrl + C to kill then run again, be nice if I could do all this from inside emacs.

I guess a bash script could be an option but curious if others have this work flow and how it works ?

Currently in a golang workflow but even better if there is a generic solution.

if i use vim bindings inside emacs (i heard that you can do that and that made me want to try emacs) how far can i go before i hit the limit of what's possible using emacs , will i have to switch back and learn normal emacs key bindings to use advanced features and configure it to my liking is there a hard limit to the customizations you can do with vim bindings 
this may seem like a stupid question but this thought of keep using vim bindings in emacs and then having to relearn all of the muscle memory again is keeping me from trying it , but i want to use something like emacs for my personal development all the time for now on to forever 
it is advisable to use emacs on windows system or should i get started with it inside my Wsl system 
any recommendations, suggestions , roadmap to learn emcas better and efficiently is very well appreciated ,any links to videos articles blogs  and resources for learning are appreciated as well",t3

One of my examples:

Because seeing a list of candidates as you type and being able to choose from it with meaningful key-bindings is way more convenient and efficient than the tab-completion-system (I think this claim is backed by the way all those external packages work; helm, ivy, vertico).

I do not know why `/bin/sh` is called

I have Msys64 installed, fzf works in my terminal. I also have `bash.exe` working fine.

In emacs, I have modified these variables in order to have `bash.exe` called instead of `/bin/sh`

- `sh-shell` is set to `bash`
- `sh-shell-file` is set to the path to `bash.exe`

I have also search for mentions of `/bin/sh` using deadgrep... nothing useful.
I do not know what to do.

please help me fix this problem.

1739bvr,47,0.98,16,47,2824,486,2023-10-08T20:39:55Z,"TL;DR Fairly new emacs user here. This is a story of how I recently had a problem and I came up with a cool way to solve it using dired, registers, regex, and macros. In particular, I realized I could maintain state during macro execution using a register. IMO I found a cool solution and I'm proud of myself.

My problem: I've been attending a class and downloaded all the lectures. Unfortunately, each lecture is in a folder named \[lecture-xyz\], and its subtitle twin is \[lecture-xyz\]\_subtitles. It was annoying to find the current lecture because nothing was sorted. I decided to prefix each folder with a number so they would sort correctly in my file manager (and dired).

The Initial Approach: I'd jump between the course website and my file manager, renaming folders one by one. It was a tedious game of find, right-click, rename, and repeat. Especially since I had to do it for both the video and subtitle folders.

I figured this was a good time to improve my dired skills!

Solution 1: I basically just replicated my initial approach in dired. Instead of scanning the directory for the lecture, mousing to it, right clicking rename, etc, I could search for the module by name, hit R, and rename. But, it still felt repetitive -- I had to do this for both the lecture and associated subtitle directory. It was also annoying to have to type the whole name in the minibuffer.

Solution 2: regex. I'd mark both lecture folders and use the replace-with-regex command. I would use `.*` as selection and `n-\&amp;` where `n` was the current number prefix. This was far better, but still pretty repetitive. I still had to keep track of the current prefix, do the regex/replace, and manually increment the prefix number in the replace regex.

Solution 3: regex + macros + registers. I loaded a register with 0. Marked the first lecture+subtitle dir. Started a macro. Did a replace regex using the same as above, except instead of typing the number, I inserted the number register. After replace, I incremented the number register, unmarked the files, and ended the macro. For subsequent lectures, I simply had to mark the lecture and hit `C-x e` No more manually keeping track of the current prefix and repeated regex replaces!

In the end, I spent more time on this than just clicking away in the file manager. But the knowledge I gained about dired, macros, and registers? Totally worth it. Especially the realization that I can use registers to maintain state during macro execution.

EDIT: also, I'm starting to understand the usefulness of typed registers. My approach used a number register + increment. In vim (I'm transitioning), I would have had to paste the number, increment it, then yank it back into the register. That would have been kinda a pain and error prone. In emacs I could simply increment. Nice!",t3

In particular, I need the following functionality:

1. Automatic newline when `|` is typed; and
2. Indent and newline when `[` is typed.

I have been looking into different ways of doing this, and I have come up with the following:

1. Using `electric-layout-mode`, e.g. `(add-to-list 'electric-layout-rules '(?| . before))`; and
2. Using `electric-indent-mode`, e.g. `(setq-local electric-indent-chars (append electric-indent-chars '(?\[)))`.

I have also read about the `electric-pairs-mode` which might be more appropriate for the latter.  There are also more manual ways of doing this, with hooks (post self insert hooks?).

However, I am struggling to find any documentation on any `electric` functions, and different other major modes do these kind of things in different ways.  My question is: what is the best way to do what I am after?  If there is one function that I can bundle both of these features in, then that might be better.  But maybe it's best that I keep these separate in case the user wants to enable, for example, layout mode but not pairs mode.

I'd love to hear from developers of major modes with experience implementing such a feature!",t3

I wanted to share a new emacs package I've been working on, which is built on top of [another project](https://github.com/jflatow/vzi) I created \~6 years ago. I let `vzi` bitrot for too long. I live inside emacs to the extent that I can, but one of the areas I've long been frustrated in is the ability to visualize data controlled from an emacs buffer. I've lately been enjoying deno, and got inspired and decided to finally rewrite `vzi` using it. Of course, I needed to be able to control it all from emacs with a few keystrokes, and hence `vzi.el` was born. If you are like me, you might appreciate these packages.

The rough architecture of `vzi` is that it controls the browser remotely using the chrome devtools protocol, and pipes data to a host page from `stdin`. A final html report is typically generated and dumped to `stdout`, although often the rendering in the browser is all you want. It can be configured to work headlessly, or even remotely.

I'm experimenting with having the host page run on a public domain (`vzi.sci.sh`), although its not necessary and things can be done completely locally using a flag. See the [README.md](https://github.com/jflatow/vzi.el) for a bit more information about how to do that. Its worth noting that even when the host page is not local, data is not sent to the server (unless the host page does that, which it doesn't).

The reason for the shared host page default, is that I am experimenting with being able to share the reports publicly. Thus, if you render using the server now, there will be a 'Share' button, which will prompt you to sign a message using a metamask wallet. It is currently configured that anyone is allowed to publish who has either ≥ 0.2 ETH or ≥ 1 [EFKR](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3a275655586a049fe860be867d10cdae2ffc0f33) in their account.

This is again, all experimental, and there are a number of things which I am working on improving:

* The MetaMask SDK is pretty buggy and leaves a lot to be desired, I would like to support a more general web3 signing method
* The server is not currently using TLS, though that will change at some point
* The UI is highly minimalistic and missing important features

But all these things are all independent from the core `vzi.el` and `vzi` packages, so I wanted to share those now anyway. I use these packages every day and hope they might be of value to you as well.",t3

Now here is an example with the various methods I know to achieve this:

    | just append | it fails | utilize calc | plain elisp |

    #+TBLFM: @&gt;$4='(format ""Sum: %i"" (apply #'+ (mapcar #'string-to-number '(@I$4..@III$4))))
    
As you can see, the first method fails in the second column, due to not all data are numbers.

Edit: some other formulas: counting the number of all entries and counting the number of  `-` entries:

    #+TBLFM: @&gt;$1='(format ""Len: %i"" (calcFunc-vlen '(vec @I$1..@III$1)))
    #+TBLFM: @&gt;$4='(format ""Number of '-': %i"" (apply #'+ (mapcar #'(lambda (x) (if (string= ""-"" x) 1 0 )) '(@I$4..@III$4))))

I got tired of trying different calendar solutions in the desktop to manage appointments, when I take notes I want to refer to the dates of events, so it makes sense to keep it all in Emacs.  
There's a lot of calendar/appointment options for org-mode, but I am not an org user, and was intrigued by the built in diary/calendar pair. After experimenting with them for a bit, and finding out there are built ins for:  
1. converting ics files to dairy-mode entries  
2. displaying notification for upcoming events  
3. communicating with DAV servers  

I decided to try to build a package to sync events between diary files and a CalDAV server. I never quite figured out #3 but I was already so into the package that it didn't matter :)  
There's a plan to have a proper info manual for the package, but for the time being, the README in the repository explains how to set it all up.  
   
Hope someone else finds this useful. I have been using to keep tabs on meeting invites for the last couple weeks, and haven't missed one yet (or, at least, not because of the package).

---

As an example of how it all fits together, here is my current configuration. With it I can see in `M-x calendar` events that I have online, and create new ones. Events updated/created in Emacs are immediately sent to the server, so I can tell if something funky happened:

      (calendar-view-diary-initially-flag t)
      :hook

And this is how it looks like when I \`cat\` from terminal, when I run the script it runs fine so it definitely has to do with the way emacs indents the file.

170klyn,3,0.72,2,3,3481,434,2023-10-05T15:17:36Z,"Looking at the docstring for`completing-read-multiple` gives one the impression that it takes the same arguments as `completing-read`.

    completing-read-multiple is an autoloaded byte-compiled Lisp function
    in ‘crm.el’.
    
    (completing-read-multiple PROMPT TABLE &amp;optional PREDICATE
    REQUIRE-MATCH INITIAL-INPUT HIST DEF INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD)
    
    Read multiple strings in the minibuffer, with completion.
    The arguments are the same as those of ‘completing-read’.
    
    Input multiple strings by separating each one with a string that
    matches the regexp ‘crm-separator’.  For example, if the separator
    regexp is "","", entering ""alice,bob,eve"" specifies the strings
    ""alice"", ""bob"", and ""eve"".
    
    We refer to contiguous strings of non-separator-characters as
    ""elements"".  In this example there are three elements.
    
    Completion is available on a per-element basis.  For example, if the
    contents of the minibuffer are ""alice,bob,eve"" and point is between
    ""l"" and ""i"", pressing TAB operates on the element ""alice"".
    
    This function returns a list of the strings that were read,
    with empty strings removed.
    
      Probably introduced at or before Emacs version 24.4.

But unless I'm missing something, this isn't quite right. In particular, the same function cannot be given as the PREDICATE argument for both `completing-read` and `completing-read-multiple` without running into trouble. 

Consider the following simple example: 

    (defvar my/test-list '((""Apples"" (:location ""refrigerator"" :amount 3))
                           (""Bananas"" (:location ""counter"" :amount 6))
                           (""Oranges"" (:location ""counter"" :amount 0))))
    
    (completing-read ""Select some items: "" my/test-list)

The possible completions I get are, as expected, ""Apples"", ""Bananas"", and ""Oranges"". 

Suppose I now want to filter the possible completions so as to include only those items whose `cdr` specify an `:amount` property greater than 0. I can then define the following function:

    (defun my/have-some (item)
      (&gt; (plist-get (car (cdr item)) :amount) 0))

and call 

    (completing-read ""Select some items: "" my/test-list #'my/have-some)

As expected, possible completions include only ""Apples"" and ""Bananas"". 

Trying to do the same thing with `completing-read-multiple` is a bit more involved. For one thing, simply trying 

    (completing-read-multiple ""Select some items: "" my/test-list #'my/have-some)

doesn't work. Here's the beginning of the backtrace: 

    Debugger entered--Lisp error: (wrong-type-argument listp ""Apples"")
      cdr(""Apples"")
      (car (cdr item))
      (plist-get (car (cdr item)) :amount)
      (&gt; (plist-get (car (cdr item)) :amount) 0)
      my/have-some(""Apples"")

I guess unlike `completing-read`, which is testing each member of `my/test-list` with `my/have-some`, `completing-read-multiple` is testing each possible completion with `my/have-some`. So in order to avoid this error, I need to define a different function to pass as the PREDICATE argument. 

This seems to do the trick: 

    (defun my/have-some-crm (item)
      (&gt; (plist-get (car (cdr (assoc item my/test-list))) :amount) 0))

Now I can call

    (completing-read-multiple ""Select some items: "" my/test-list #'my/have-some-crm)

and get the behavior I expect. 

Am I right that the docstring for `completing-read-multiple` needs to be fixed? Or am I misunderstanding something?",t3

There are obvious performance reasons for  this, and it is usually  what I want -- except for when I am doing my daily journaling, when it would be massively useful to pull up the agenda AS IF I  were on a previous day (usually ""yesterday""). I only need this to be done once, for when I am journaling. How can I make a ""view as today"" command for my orgmode agenda?",t3
